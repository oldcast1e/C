my
name
is
joe
cooper
last
year
i
was
so
proud
to
be
named
student
of
the
year
that
i
thought
my
chest
was
going
to
burst
when
i
was
on
stage
i
learned
first
hand
what
gill
is
all
about
giving
to
others
unselfishly
this
year
at
the
gill
recognition
party
on
april
there

a
silent

sponsored
by
the
students
we
as
students
thank
you
for
donating
field
we
got
for
the
auction
i
truly
believe
god
had
a
purpose
for
me
when
i
walked
into
the
marion
county
library
and
asked
the
librarian
if
she
could
teach
me
to
read
it
was
like
a
guardian
angel
had
come
down
to
guide
my
feet
into
that
door
when
she
directed
me
to
gill
i
can
not
begin
to
tell
you
how
gill
has
changed
my
life
all
of
the
staff
and
my
tutor
have
been
so
friendly
and
helpful
they
made
me
realize
that
i
am
a
worthwhile
human
being
i
don
t
know
why
god
chose
me
i
just
know
he
did
and
i
plan
to
make
something
of
my
life
with
gill
s
help
i
volunteer
for
student
meetings
leadership
council
and
speaking
engagements
your
gift
is
appreciated
by
each
and
every

benefit
from
your
generosity
gill

make
a
difference
in

president
student
leadership

p
s
it
took
me
and
hours
to
type
this
on
the
computer
because
my
writing
skills
need
a
lot
of
practice
yet
but
my
tutor
helped
me
with
only
a
few
words
she
is
a
drill
sergeant
making
me
do
all
the
work
dear
employer
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
you
face
may
be
to
find
qualified
educated
people
to
fill
positions
in
your
company
the
number
of
companies
reporting
a
shortage
of
skilled
workers
almost
doubled
from
to
from
percent
to
more
than
percent
did
you
know
that
about
percent
of
america
s
workers
have
low
basic
skills
and
percent
of
unemployed
adults
have
reading
or
writing
difficulties
indy

is
working
to
change
that
the

statistics
change
little
from

did

know
that
the
combined
efforts
of
all
literacy
programs
in
the
country
reach
only
ten
percent
of
adults
with
reading
problems
the
department
of
labor
estimates
business
and
taxpayers
foot
a
bill
of
billion
a

a

caused
by
workplace
accidents
lost

unrealized
tax

welfare
payments
and
crime
indy

dear
mr
name
the
salvation
army
received
a
note
not
long
ago
from
a
woman
who
makes
contributions
to
our
programs
from
time
to
time
she
d
been
thinking
about
our
camping
program
for
children
her
note
explained
that
while
driving
through
the
country
recently
in
a
rare
moment
when
she
didn
t
have
a
lot
on
her
mind
she
found
herself
truly
aware
of
her
surroundings
lush
green
fields
that
stretched
for
miles
wisps
of
white
clouds
scattered
across
a
clear
blue
sky
tranquil
silence
broken
only
by
cheerful
bird
songs
the
fresh
sweet
scent
of
morning
air
and
she
felt
a
sense
of
peace
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
what
a
contrast
from
the
city
she
d
left
a
few
miles
back
filthy
sidewalks
where
children
play
boarded
up
buildings
where
people
live
blaring
sirens
and
horrendous
crime
she
recalled
a
report
on
tv
the
night
before
about
a
teenager
who
shot
an
even
younger
boy
to
death
as
part
of
a
gang
initiation
she
has
a
hard
time
understanding
why
things
like
this
happen
why
some
children
have
no
respect
for
life
not
even
their
own
she
wondered
what
would
happen
if
she
could
take
one
child
from
the
city
and
place
that
youngster
where
she
was
now
in
the
midst
of
this
beauty
and
serenity
what
would
change
for
that
boy
or
girl
that
s
when
she
thought
about
the
salvation
army
s
camping
program
she
remembered
reading
how
kids
from
the
indiana
cities
spend
a
week
every
summer
at
hidden
falls
camp
they
spend
most
of
their
time
outdoors
playing
games
with
new
friends
discovering
flowers
they
ve
never
seen
and
creating
treasures
from
sticks
rocks
and
leaves
here
kids
get
their
fill
of
good
food
love
and
attention
things
many
of
them
get
too
little
of
at
home
with
her
note
she
enclosed
a
check
for
to
send
one
child
to
camp
this
summer
she
d
never
given
that
much
money
before
but
she
was
convinced
it
would
make
a
difference
it
s
hard
to
explain
exactly
how
camp
can
change
a
child
s
heart
but
i
know
it
does
kids
probably
wonder
what
god
looks
like
if
i
could
speak
to
them
i
would
tell
them
they
can
see
a
great
deal
of
god
in
the
trees
and
stars
and
streams
that
he
created
when
they
re
running
with
the
wind
in
their
faces
and
the
sun
on
their
backs
or
stepping
barefoot
onto
cool
green
grass
they
would
begin
to
understand
what
i
mean
i
m
telling
you
all
this
because
perhaps
you
too
are
asking
questions
why
one
child
takes
the
life
of
another
why
children
feel
so
empty
inside
that
they
turn
to
drugs
to
fill
the
void
why
they
have
so
little
self
worth
that
they
value
the
friendship
of
thieves
and
killers
and
perhaps
you
re
also
asking
what
can
i
do
i
don
t
have
all
the
answers
but
i
am
certain
of
this
you
can
make
a
difference
in
one
child
s
life
by
sending
a
gift
to
the
salvation
army
s
camping
program
it
costs
approximately
to
send
one
boy
or
girl
from
central
indiana
to
camp
for
a
week
that
may
sound
like
a
lot
however
when
you
consider
transportation
food
lodging
crafts
sports
counseling
and
much
more
you
realize
it
covers
a
lot
and
equals
what
you
might
pay
for
a
night
or
two
of
lodging
at
a
hotel
if
you
can
t
sponsor
a
child
for
a
whole
week
perhaps
you
can
send
enough
for
half
a
week
or
even
just
one
day
your
contribution
may
also
be
used
to
support
our
year
round
programs
for
children
you
see
camp
is
only
the
first
step
through
the
year
we
also
offer
a
number
of
different
programs
including
scouting
basketball
and
after
school
activities
to
help
children
develop
talents
character
and
self
esteem
please
prayerfully
consider
how
much
you
can
give
and
give
just
a
little
more
i
guarantee
you
ll
feel
good
knowing
you
ve
helped
us
touch
a
heart
perhaps
you
ll
even
save
a
life
at
the
very
least
you
ll
give
one
child
the
chance
to
see
god
s
face
and
feel
his
love
often

it

mrs
name
ted
is
a
single
father
with
three
children
under
he
s
never
been
on
welfare
and
he
s
always
had
a
job
doing
manual
labor
life
isn
t
easy
for
ted
but
he
s
determined
to
raise
his
children
himself
and
be
a
good
role
model
for
them
it
wasn
t
always
like
that
there
was
a
time
when
he
felt
like
he
had
no
choice
but
to
tolerate
his
wife
s
constant
abuse
and
neglect
of
their
children
then
ted
decided
the
children
deserved
a
chance
to
start
over
in
another
town
no
matter
how
difficult
it
might
prove
to
be
what
happens
when
people
are
living
on
the
edge
barely
able
to
survive
and
an
unexpected
emergency
arises
what
happens
if
they
can
t
pay
their
heating
or
electric
bill
because
of
extreme
temperatures
what
happens
if
their
children
get
sick
what
happens
if
they
get
sick
starting
over
can
be
very
hard
especially
for
people
who
don
t
have
family
or
financial
resources
to
draw
from
in
an
emergency
that
s
why
i

writing

although
it

how
sweet
the
sound
the
words
of
this
familiar
hymn
have
echoed
through
churches
all
across
the
globe
for
over
years
grace
is
sometimes
defined
as
undeserved
favor
have
you
ever
stopped
to
consider
how
grace
is
given
to
people
i
like
to
think
of
the
salvation
army
as
a
place
of
grace
where
individuals
and
families
find
love
and
help
in
their
time
of
need
regardless
of
the
situations
that
bring
them
to
us

healing

comfort
food

assistance
and
underprivileged
children
have
the
opportunity
to
eat
well
balanced

god
s
grace
is
found
in
his
forgiveness
and
unconditional
love
in
turn
we
have
the
opportunity
to
extend
that
grace
to
others
by
meeting
their
physical
and
spiritual
needs
with
kindness
and
compassion
here
at
the
salvation
army
this
is
our
continuous
goal
maybe
you
can
remember
a
time
in
your
own
life
when
you
were
shown
grace
when
someone
reached
out
to
you
with
answers
you
couldn
t
find
yourself
or
perhaps
a
specific
person
comes
to
mind
such
as
a
sister
a
grandfather
or
a
daughter
whose
life
is
characterized
by
grace
when
i
think
of
grace
i
am
reminded
of
the
many
salvation
army
officers
and
employees
who
selflessly
dedicate
their
lives
to
the
poor
and
brokenhearted
in
my
years
of
working
with
the
salvation
army
i
ve
seen
grace
transform
the
lives
of
many
people
often
those
who
come
to
us
for
help
have
exhausted
all
other
resources
but
the
love
assistance
and
guidance
that
we
offer
them
hope
for
a
better
tomorrow
i
can
think
of
no
better
time
to
continue
extending
grace
to
others
than
at
easter
this
special
season
reminds
us
that
god
s
mercy
is
available
to
each
of
us
regardless
of
who
we
are
or
what
we
we
ve
done
in
the
same
way
the

offers
grace
and
compassion
to
those
in
need
in
our

regardless
of
the
difficulties
they

be
facing

it
surprise
you
to
learn
that
less
than
two
years
away
from

the
problem
of
supplying

is
one

in

indiana

rank
in

sad
when
i
couldn
t
go
to
the
snack
bar
to
buy
a
soda
now
i
can
buy
a
soda
and
spend
money
i
like
working
and
making
money
i
have
a
savings
account
i
can
write
my
name
on
the
deposit
slip
if
i
wasn
t
working
here
i
would
be
sad
maureen
because
turning
welfare
recipients
into
tax
payers
just
makes
sense
when
i
first
came
to
goodwill
i
was
a
single
parent
with
little
or
no
self
esteem
i
was
on
welfare
and
without
my
diploma
coming
to
goodwill
was
the
first
step
toward
my
becoming
totally
independent
i
am
now
totally
off
of
welfare
i
really
like
my
job
sherry
because
people
want
to
work
i
d
never
finished
high
school
i
had
no
experience
or
skills
the
only
thing
i
did
know
for
sure
was
here
s
a
chance
to
change
things
for
me
and
my
children
i
rode
a
bike
to
goodwill
in
the
rain
and
snow
i
wanted
to
be
there
i
had
my
second
chance
to
change
my
life
donna
because
teaching
a
man
to
fish
will
keep
him
fed
for
his
entire
life
before
i
got
to
goodwill
i
was
on
a
mission
i
just
wanted
a
job
it
didn
t
matter
what
the
job
was
i
just
wanted
one
now
i
m
on
a
journey
i
ve
got
more
than
a
job
i
ve
got
a
career
my
instructor
played
a
role
like
no
other
instructor
i
ve
ever
had
i

be
honest

of
the
people

t
working

quite
simply
the
ones
who
face
the
greatest
obstacles
the
kinds
of
services
we
provide
help
people
deal
with
obstacles
like
health
care
transportation
and
child
care
problems
that
are
big
enough
on
their
own
without
being
compounded
by
factors
like
physical
and
mental
disabilities
illiteracy
and
lack
of
job
skills
last
year
goodwill
helped
people
find
jobs
that
increased
their
self
sufficiency
your
gift
to
goodwill
will
be
used
directly
to
support
services
that
will

valuable
while

the
true

takes
on
problems
that
affect
all
of
us
every
time
we
help
someone
find
a
solution
to
their

the

of
inspiring
results
i

more
in

to

your
greatest

of
the
joy
and
success
they
bring
to
you
and
your
loved
ones
michael
sims
felt
that
way
at
age
the
day
he
earned
a
job
michael
was
born
with
cerebral
palsy
upon
entering
the
work
force
he
discovered
few
job
opportunities
that
seemed
to
match
his
abilities
for
several
years
he
performed
packaging
and
clerical
work
his
most
recent
job
lasted
only
a
year
before
cut
backs
eliminated
his
position
for
long
months
michael
could
not
find
a
job
he
resorted
to
public
assistance
dollars
to
survive
finally
michael
called
goodwill
at
goodwill
michael
s
counselors
felt
that
his
personable
demeanor
could
be
a
major
attribute
and
identified
for
him
a
possible
job
match
where
his
people
skills
could
shine
after
three
interviews
michael
proved
that
he
was
the
right
person
for
the
job
as
the
clubhouse
monitor
at
bent
tree
apartments
he
now
provides
customer
service
for
to
tenants
each
night
at
last
he
has
found
success
in
a
job
that
he
loves
now
his
goals
are
set
on
moving
up
in
the
company
every
year
thousands
of
people
come
to
goodwill
like
michael
they
share
two
common
characteristics
they
face
some
barrier
to
employment
and
they
want
to
work
with
support
from
people
like
you
they
can
overcome
their
barriers
and
earn
success
and
the
self
sufficiency
that
comes
with
it
and
then
the
pay
off
begins
for
the
entire
community
individual
successes
at
goodwill
mean
fewer
persons
receiving
public
support
and
more
paying
taxes
last
year
participants
in
goodwill
programs
earned
and
paid
taxes
on
wages
of
nearly
million
their
successes
at
work
also
saved
taxpayers
more
than
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars
in
public
assistance
the
savings
are
counted
in
more
ways
than
dollars
and
cents
however
the
families
of
the
new
wage
earners
may
feel
the
accomplishment
in
terms
of
a
house
to
live
in
money
to
purchase
food
without
food
stamps
and
the
beginning
of
a
family
focused
on
success
not
hopelessness
won
t
you
help
make
all
of
these
successes
possible
please
send
the
largest
contribution
you
can
comfortably
make
your
gift
will
help
give
new
meaning
to
the
word
success
for
people
who
have
seldom
had
reason
to
use
the
word
sincerely

p
s
your
gift
will
make
a
difference
for
every
dollar
of
public
support
goodwill
received
last
year
we
returned
to
the
community
in
the
form
of
earned
wages
and
reduced
public
assistance
payments
some
of
the
strongest
critics
of
our
welfare
system
are
the
people
who
have
become
dependent
on
it
their
complaint
the
system
discourages
working
because
unemployment
provides
benefits
that
many
entry
level
jobs
don
t
include
that
s
where
you
and
goodwill
come
in
we
help
people
train
for
and
find
jobs
that
make
it
possible
for
them
to
get
off
of
welfare
last
year
goodwill
placed
people
in
jobs
more
than
double
the
number
we
placed
in
while
the
debate
on
welfare
reform
is
gathering
like
a
storm
at
sea
the
people
who
need
jobs
are
floundering
we
need
your
support
to
continue
getting
people
off
of
public
assistance
welfare
is
not
the
answer
and
welfare
reform
is
an
uncertain
solution
with
an
unknown
starting

works
right
now

to

do
you
remember
the
combination

elation
and
apprehension
you
felt
when
you
first
left
home
the
young
adults
who
leave
pleasant
run
have
those
same
feelings
very
few
have
family
support
to
get
them
started
many
need
furniture
linens
and
other
basic
necessities
to
begin
lives
on
their
own
to
help
them
establish
themselves
in
the
community
the

was
begun
in
by
private

who
wanted
to
provide
a
measure
of
financial
support
for
those

pleasant

with
a
multitude
of
problems

yesterday
that

group
they
decided
they
had
to
earn
the
right
to
ask
others
for
help
by
accomplishing
something
real
to
help
themselves
and
that
s
from
kids
many
people
see
as
a
problem
even
after
the
summer
sessions
come
to
a
close
jameson
campers
will
take
part
in
year
round
programs
designed

keep
that

what
has
your

of
our

and
what
have
they

to
accomplish
because
you
care
the
best
indicator
i
can
give
you
of
the

is
the

the

few
years
this

has
grown
from

a
team
of
almost
young

at
risk
children

years
earlier

now
have
the
opportunity
to
be
a
stable
positive
and
important
part
of
each
child
s
life
for
an
entire
decade
the
teens
have
also
decided
to
raise
money
to
provide
camperships
for
other
campers
because
they
know
what
jameson
has
meant
to
them
and
their
activities
aren
t
isolated
to
jameson

undertaken
a

a
local
hospital

in
the
summer
of
the
marion
county
commission
on
youth
began
what
can
best
be
described
as
a
new
era
in
its
history
mccoy
was
reorganized
as
an
independent
not
for
profit
agency
separate
from
local
government
it
retained
however
the
same
mission
with
which
it
had
been
charged
from
its
inception
to
serve
as
a
catalyst
for
effective
coordinated
and
collaborative
service
delivery
to
youth
in
our
community
for
the
past
three
years
mccoy
has
been
actively
engaged
in
accomplishing
this
declared
mission
in
cooperation
with
many
others
youth
service
providers
youth
funding
bodies
and
interested
citizens
to
name
a
few
we
have
met
with
a
number
of
successes
along
the
way
most
notably
the
summer
fun
line
the
metro
summer
bus
pass
and
the
development
of
ten
neighborhood
youth
councils
a

council
and
a
youth
coalition
are
building
relationships
that
will
hopefully
bear
great
fruit
in
the
years
to
come
the
formation
of
the
community
academy
a
pilot
project
directed
at
expelled
students
from
local
school
systems
has
come
about
as
a
result
of
mccoy
s
efforts
to
mobilize
community
agencies
in
response
to
a
pressing
issue
mccoy
is
actively
represented
and
working
with
numerous
community
collaborations
where
we
regularly
raise
our
voice
to
speak
out
for
the
inclusion
of
young
people
in
both
decision
making
and
program
planning
processes
one
concrete
example
is
a
joint
project
undertaken
in
the
united
northwest
area
in
partnership
with
the
junior
league
of
indianapolis
and
community
partnerships
with
youth
from
fort
wayne
indiana
as
a
team
these
three
organizations
are
working
with
neighborhood
youth
and
adults
to
build
a
caring
neighborhood
with
youth
mobilizing
the
assets
of
young
people
and
adults
as
partners
to
build
a
better
neighborhood
for
all
since
its
re
organization
mccoy
has
established
its
unique
niche
within
the
community
by
refraining
from
direct
service
programming
and
focusing
on
what
it
does
best
helping
to
identify
youth
needs
convening
groups
of
individuals
and
organizations
which
can
address
those
needs
and
moving
toward
collaborative
solutions
mccoy
has
only
one
interest
the
well
being
of
marion

s
young
people
mccoy
invites
the
support
of
the

in
the
amount
of

support
such
activities
as
the
co

of

the

efficient

delivery
the

for
the
positive
growth
of
all
marion

young
people
in
the
last
several
years
the
business
and
corporate
community
has
recognized
that
the
positive
development
of
youth
is
directly
related
to
the
development
of
a
competent
workforce
youth
who
are
supported
and
encouraged
by
both
a
family
and
a
society

a
much
greater
likelihood
of
becoming
productive

contributing
members
of

society
while
we
have
made
significant
inroads
there
remains
much
to
be
done
and
it
is
clear
that
we
cannot
do
it
alone
we
seek
the
financial
support
of

be
successful
in
creating

it
s
tough
growing
up
today
we
know
that
children
do
better
when
they
have
a
network
of
caring
adults
to
nurture
and
motivate
them
when
young
people
don
t
have
that
support
they
need
other
resources
for
encouragement
to
guide
them
along
the
way
big

helps
bridge
that
gap
by
providing
children
with
the
resources
they
need
big

big

are
mentors
and

who
empower
girls
to
more
fully
reach
their
potential
experience
life
s
opportunities
and
perhaps
begin
to
dream
the
relationships
that
are
formed
provide
strong
foundations
from
which
healthy
values
and
strong
self

can
grow
helping

become

adolescence
it
is
a
pivotal
time
in
the
life
of
a
young
girl
when
small
changes
in
her
behavior
or
the
choices
she
makes
can
affect
her
future
it
s
hard
enough
for
her
to
make
good
decisions
when
she
s
surrounded
by
support
it
s
even
harder
when
she
isn
t
big

that
void
by

helping

the
self

life
skills
necessary
to

governor
dear
friend
in
looking
back
at
and
forward
to
the
new
millennium
we
can
be
thankful
that
these
are
prosperous
times
for
indiana
more
hoosiers
are
working
and
earning
higher
incomes
than
at
any
time
in
our
history
we
are
creating
new
businesses
jobs
and
housing
at
a
record
pace
and
our
population
is
growing
for
the
first
time
in
decades
as
our
state
continues
to
develop
we
must
work
harder
to
protect
important
natural
areas
for
wildlife
and
recreation
thousands
of
hoosier
motorists
have
been
doing
just
that
by
purchasing
environmental
license
plates
nearly
of
the
distinctive
plates
with
the
eagle
and
sun
design
have
been
sold
or
renewed
generating
more
than
million
since
the
indiana
general
assembly
also
has
played
an
important
part
appropriating
million
for
the
program
the
indiana
heritage
trust
program
has
bought
and
protected
more
than
acres
for
parks
forests
wildlife
nature
preserves
and
recreation
three
years
ago
the
heritage
trust
set
aside
land
for
the
restoration
of
the
limberlost
swamp
near
geneva
in
eastern
indiana
this
is
the
wetland
celebrated
by
gene
stratton
porter
in
her
books
poems
and
photographs
now
wildlife
is
returning
to
the
area
egrets
ducks
and
geese
now
gather
at
waterfowl
resting
ponds
in
large
numbers
and
native
prairie
grass
has
been
planted
to
return
natural
diversity
and
other
wildlife
to
the
area
the
limberlost
is
one
of
more
than
projects
in
which
you
have
invested
by
purchasing
an
environmental
license
plate
one
year
ago
i
asked
you
to
join
me
in
renewing
your
environmental
license
plate
so
our
children
and
grandchildren
can
see
the
majesty
of
a
bald
eagle
soaring
over
indiana
s
rural
hills
and
valleys
so
we
can
float
down
a
river
in
a
canoe
and
enjoy
the
breathtaking
scenery
or
so
we
can
hike
through
the
woods
and
see
wildflowers
in
the
spring
i
ask
you
to
join
me
again
this
year
in
supporting
the
program
that
is
doing
so
much
to
preserve
and
protect
our
natural
heritage
sincerely
frank
o
bannon
springtime
dear
friends
of
the
pelicans
twelve
baby
pelicans
were
hatched
and
raised
this
year
just
outside
our
pens
by
the
wild
pelicans
that
hang
around
the
seabird
station
the
permanently
injured
pelicans
inside
our
pens
are
still
waiting
for
the
approval
of
the
florida
fish
and
wildlife
conservation
commission
and
the
u
s
fish
wildlife
service
approval
before
they
can
breed
one
little
pelican
was
abandoned
by
his
parents
in
their
haste
to
start
a
second
mating
and
nesting
in
the
same
season
he
was
about
two
weeks
short
of
being
old
enough
to
fly
but
still
afraid
of
people
and
very
difficult
to
catch
so
that
we
could
continue
feeding
until
he
was
self
sufficient
after
five
days
of
self
imposed
starvation
harry
cornered
him
behind
an
aviary
and
fed
him
and
he
immediately
jerked
away
running
and
flapping
to
the
water
s
edge
where
he
sat
with
a
pouch
full
of
fish
the
next
morning
and
every
day
for
the
next
two
weeks
he
was
in
the
corner
behind
the
aviary
waiting
for
harry
now
he
comes
running
out
from
there
whenever
he
sees
harry
how
quickly
they
learn
bad
habits
our
problem
now
is
how
to
teach
him
to
go
out
and
catch
his
own
fish
instead
of
waiting
to
catch
harry
behind
the
aviary
the
smallest
baby
duck
we
have
ever
seen
was
brought
to
our
door
about
three
weeks
ago
we
think
it
is
a
wild
mallard
duck
the
rescuer
said
the
mother
abandoned
this
baby
we
put
the
little
fellow
in
an
indoor
cage
and
fed
it
for
about
a
day
until
we
noticed
that
it
was
getting
entirely
too
attuned
to
people
peeping
a
little
greeting
whenever
someone
passed
his
cage
this
can
lead
to
a
condition
called
imprinting
where
the
baby
grows
up
thinking
it
is
a
people
instead
of
a
duck
although
this
results
in
a
cute
pet
it
is
a
disaster
to
the
duck
because
it
looks
to
people
for
its
normal
social
interaction
even
the
most
intimate
kind
in
an
effort
to
avoid
imprinting
we
enlisted
the
aid
of
a
regular
barnyard
muscovy
duck
that
was
hanging
around
the
seabird
station
we
put
the
baby
mallard
in
a
small
aviary
with
the
half
grown
muscovy
and
it
worked
we
were
delighted
to
see
the
muscovy
sitting
down
and
just
the
head
of
the
baby
mallard
peeking
out
from
under
its
breast
the
next
day
when
we
went
out
to
the
aviary
we
were
concerned
that
we
didn
t
see
the
baby
even
when
the
muscovy
stood
up
and
walked
to
the
other
corner
of
the
aviary
until
the
baby
fell
out
from
under
its
wing
the
baby
mallard
will
probably
think
it
s
a
muscovy
when
it
grows
up
but
that
s
better
than
imprinting
as
a
people
begin
r
we
ve
had
about
cases
of
botulism
among
the
sick
or
injured
pelicans
that
we
ve
received
in
the
last
two
months
which
is
about
as
many
botulism
cases
as
we
normally
get
in
an
entire
year
we
ve
only
been
able
to
save
about
of
those
birds
by
supporting
them
with
i
v
fluids
given
through
the
wing
bones
the
preferred
method
in
birds
botulism
is
caused
by
the
toxins
excreted
from
bacteria
that
sometimes
occurs
naturally
when
vegetable
matter
decays
anaerobically
without
oxygen
under
the
mud
it
then
bubbles
to
the
surface
of
the
water
and
a
small
amount
is
ingested
by
the
pelican
when
he
eats
the
botulism
research
laboratory
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
gave
us
doses
of
experimental
botulism
anti
toxin
about
two
weeks
ago
the
trick
is
to
catch
the
botulism
in
the
very
early
stages
before
the
toxin
attacks
the
nerves
and
causes
progressive
paralysis
the
problem
here
is
that
some
paralysis
is
usually
the
first
visible
symptom
we
ll
let
you
know
if
this
anti
toxin
turns
out
to
be
the
silver
bullet
that
solves
the
botulism
problem

thanks

all
of
you

jon

drive

in
come
from
nashua
of
that
number
are
stray
lost
pets
last
year
we
aided
stray
animals
but
of
them
were
never
claimed
by
their
owners
incoming
strays
increased
by
over
the
last
three
years
and
is
expected
to
continue
to
climb
almost
of
our
operating
budget

consumed
by
programs
to
serve
stray
and
unwanted
animals
the
national

standard
is
all
these
animals
need
some
form
of
costly
care
including
boarding
food
medical
care
testing
surgery
medicine
training
or
physical

we
are
faced
with
the
real
possibility
of
turning
away
animals
if

not
increase
our
goal
for
the
remainder
of
this
year
is
to
raise
to
meet
the
operating

please

today
your
humane
society
provides
not
only
effective
community
social
services
for
animals
and
their
people
but
also
serves
as
the
pound
for
the
city
of
nashua
pound
services
ensure
that
lost
pets
have
a
clean
and
safe
place
to
stay
and
be
cared
for
until
their
owners
can
be
located
in
the
case
of
animals
that
are
not
recovered
by
their
owners
your
humane
society
uses
a
wide
variety
of
services
to
aid
those
animals
and
give
them
a
chance
at
a
happy
life
while
every
animal
that
makes
it
to
the
humane
society
receives
the
care
it
needs
and
deserves
the
ones
that
go
unrecovered
claim
the
lion
s
share
of
resources
for
years
we
have
been
under
contract
with
the
city
of
nashua
to
provide
these
services
as
mandated
by
state
law
over
the
years
the
humane
society
has
lobbied
the
mayor
s
office
for
ever
increasing
levels
of
funding
to
help
us
meet
expenses
in
the
past
our
relationship
with
the
city
has
been
quite
good
but
we
have
never
been
able
to
achieve
funding
for
the
services
the
city
expects
and
that
which
the
community
requires
instead
the
city
provided
only
of
our
revenues
twenty
one
years
of
providing
care
for
an
increasing
number
of
animals
has
eroded
the
humane
society
s
reserve
funds
to
one
minor
emergency
and
we
could
be
wiped
out
the
most
recent
three
year
pound
contract
with
the
city
expired
on
june
six
months
prior
to
that
we
began
working
with
mayor
streeter
s
office
to
negotiate
a
new
agreement
that
would
provide
the
funds
we
need
to
continue
full
service
to
the
community
without
suffering
the
ongoing
operating
deficits
we
have
endured
for
over
years
mayor
streeter
was
sensitive
to
our
needs
but
cited
the
spending
cap
as
the
roadblock
to
providing
us
with
sufficient
funding
in
june
the
mayor
sponsored
a
resolution
seeking
per
year
to
fund
our
contract
for
one
year
with
a
provision
to
seek
an
additional
from
the
contingency
budget
in
january
the
city
s
finance
committee
approved
that
contract
on
july
rd
but
if
the
additional
is
not
approved
by
the
board
of
aldermen
in
january
our
board
of
trustees
will
be
forced
to
cut

over
the
course
of
the
next
year
executive

mike

along
with
the

sincerely
dear
have
you
noticed
your
friends
mentioning
fountain
square
lately
it
seems
that
everywhere
i
go
people
are
making
positive
observations
about
how
our
community
is
on
the
upswing
this
shift
in
our
neighborhood
image
is
very
satisfying
after
fifteen
years
of
concerted
efforts
by
south
east
neighborhood
development
send
to
reverse
community
decline
in
community
residents
and
organizations
banded
together
to
form
the
organization
which
is
now
called
send
send
s
redevelopment
efforts
have
played
a
major
role
in
rebirth
of
fountain
square
directly
investing
more
than
million
into
affordable
housing
commercial
development
and
beautification
project
since
this
investment
has
resulted
in
the
renovation
and
sale
of
homes
to
homebuyers
of
modest
means
and
in
the
rehab
of
more
than
affordable
high
quality
apartments
more
than
low
income
home
owners
often
senior
citizens
have
been
able
to
remain
in
their
homes
thanks
to
home
repairs
supported
by
send
more
than
businesses
have
been
able
to
expand
and
employ
more
residents
two
hundred
at
risk
neighborhood
youth
have
gained
work
and
life
skills
to
overcome
the
appeal
of
gangs
drugs
and
school
drop
out
which
constantly
threaten
their
future
these
direct
investments
by
send
have
been
a
catalyst
encouraging
millions
more
in
investments
by
residents
and
businesses
who
now
hold
hope
for
the
neighborhood
s
future
while
the
trends
of
decline
are
reversing
our
work
is
far
from
complete
thousands
of
residents
still
live
in
sub
standard
conditions
our
teen
pregnancy
rate
is
the
highest
in
the
state
only
one
third
of
residents
have
high
school
diplomas
and
half
of
our
residents
have
little
hope
of
participating
in
community
improvements
because
they
do
not
own
their
home
we
need
your
help
to
continue
our
work
particularly
as
we
enable
area
families
with
low
incomes
to
become
home
owners
the
cost
of
creating
these
homes
far
exceeds
what
our
buyers
cm
pay
so
we
rely
on
grants
and
individual
donations
to
keep
them
affordable
i
hope
you
will
take
this
opportunity
to
make
a
contribution
to
support
send
s
homeownership
work
as
a
bonus
we
are
now
able
to
offer
donors
of
or
more
a
state
of
indiana
neighborhood
assistance
program
nap
tax
credit
this
means
that
half
of
your
contribution
will
be
returned
to
you
through
state
tax
savings
while
the
entire
donation
amount
will
remain
deductible
on
your
federal
taxes
most
donors
of
will
actually
be
contributing
less
than
while
send
benefits
from
the
entire
gift
however
these
tax
credits
are
only
available
for
a
limited
time
so
we
ask
that
you
act
soon
if
you
would
like
to
use
them
please
join
us
as
we
continue
to
rebuild
this
historic
neighborhood
into
a
place
of
pride
and
community
strength
feel
free
to
call

the

at
a
time
as
you

send

a
neighborhood
based
organization
investing
in
greater
fountain

housing
youth
and
economic
future
in
the
past
eight
years
send
has
renovated
over
homes
for
affordable

to
families
created
more
than
high

apartments
assisted
businesses
to
expand
or
improve
their
facilities
created
three
new
parks
and
taught
more
than
youth
work
ethics
and

we
have
directly
invested
over
million
into

through
these
programs
and
transformed
hundreds
of
lives
the
upcoming
year
offers
even
more
exciting
opportunities
we
are
currently
finalizing
plans
for
the
transformation
of
the
old
g
c
murphy
store
in
fountain
square
into
retail
office
and
residential
space
which
will
provide
another
anchor
for
the
commercial
district
we
have
implemented
a
computer
training
program
for
at
risk
neighborhood
youth
by
partnering
with
eight
other
local
agencies
we
are
also
studying
the
transformation
of
a
blighted
warehouse
building
into
artists
live
work
loft
space
which
could
become
a
cultural
and
economic
magnet
for
the
area
the
impact
of
these
projects
will
be
accelerated
by
an
economic
development
initiative
launched
this
year
which
will
enable
new
and
existing
businesses
to
flourish
in
this
neighborhood
send
advances
these
efforts
by
forming
long
standing
relationships
with
local
businesses
churches
residents
and
other
interested
groups
and
individuals
our
records
indicate
that
last
year
you
contributed
to
our
organization
we
would
like
to
expand
our
relationship
by
asking
that
you
make
a
tax
deductible
contribution
to
the
work
of
send
if
such
a
contribution
is
not
feasible
at
this
time
we
would
of
course
welcome
a
renewal
of
last

commitment

dear
habitat
partner
as
you
know
just
a
few
short
weeks
from
now
families
everywhere
will
be
celebrating
mother
s
day
honoring
mothers
in
ways
that
have
become
so
familiar
to
all
of
us
over
the
years
there
ll
be
greeting
cards
filled
with
loving
sentiments
and
brightly
wrapped
gifts
too
there
ll
also
be
long
distance
phone
calls
from
the
children
or
maybe
even
dinner
for
mom
at
a
local
restaurant
and
for
those
whose
mothers
are
now
deceased
there
ll
be
moments
of
remembrance
and
prayer
expressing
gratitude
to
god
for
a
lifetime
s
worth
of
love
and
protection
as
a
newfound
appreciation
of
the
mother
s
day
gestures
that
come
from
their
own
children
just
about
everyone
i
know
has
experienced
these
kinds
of
things
over
the
years
to
mark
this
day
but
today
i
am
asking
you
to
be
even
more
aware
of
mother
s
day
this
year
and
what
it
means
to
women
and
children
in
need
because
i
doubt
that
you
have
ever
encountered
a
mother
like
the
pensacola
florida
woman
i
want
to
tell
you
about
nor
have
you
experienced
a
mother
s
day
ending
that
is
so
glorious
as
this
one
and
when
i
m
finished
telling
you
her
incredible
story
i
m
hoping
you
will
see
your
way
clear
to
send
habitat
for
humanity
a
generous
tax
deductible
contribution
to
help
make
the
same
kind
of
joyous
ending
possible
for
so
many
other
mothers
and
their
families
who
have
the
same
urgent
need
for
a
simple
decent
house
and
the
sense
of
hope
that
goes
along
with
it
before
i
tell
you
more
about
that
remarkable
woman
in
pensacola
however
a
woman
named
wanda
rudolph
whose
love
compassion
and
sense
of
generosity
ought
to
be
an
example
to
everyone
i
want
to
tell
you
just
a
little
bit
about
what
every
mother
trying
to
go
it
alone
with
her
children
on
a
marginal
or
worse
income
is
facing
put
plainly
there
is
no
way
to
overstate
the
alarm
everyone
in
america
ought
to
feel
over
the
fact
that
childhood
poverty
despite
our
nation
s
skyrocketing
wealth
is
still
on
the
increase
nor
can
i
overstate
the
fear
that
every
low
income
mother
throughout
the
united
states
and
around
the
world
must
carry
with
her
every
day
that
the
consequences
of
poverty
will
ultimately
catch
up
with
her
children
too
consequences
of
poverty
include
inadequate
nutrition
and
its
effects
such
as
the
real
possibility
of
slow
mental
development
or
the
childhood
maladies
left
untreated
because
there
is
no
money
for
a
doctor
or
the
terrible
cycle
of
poor
self
esteem
bad
study
habits
unfulfilled
potential
and
a
life
ultimately
lived
without
hope
in
the
united
states
we
have
a
rate
of
childhood
poverty
that
is
higher
sometimes
two
or
three
times
higher
than
other
major
western
industrialized
nations
more
than
one
fifth
of
the
children
in
this
rich
nation
live
in
poverty
indeed
while
many
americans
grew
wealthier
during
the
s
and
s
the
rate
of
childhood
poverty
in
america
was
actually
rising
by
percent
this
tragic
background
brings
me
to
the
story
of
wanda
rudolph
of
pensacola
florida
who
made
a
courageous
decision
on
behalf
of
her
family
a
year
ago
a
year
old
single
mother
wanda
was
already
up
against
the
hard
economic
realities
presented
by
three
young
children
more
than
five
years
of
working
at
a
local
fast
food
chain
had
allowed
her
to
keep
food
on
the
table
and
pay
the
rent
for
the
small
two
bedroom
apartment
they
shared
but
not
much
more
things
were
certainly
not
easy
but
wanda
was
determined
to
give
her
kids
the
very
best
life
she
could
just
like
her
own
mother
had
for
her
a
mother
wanda
describes
as
a
wonderful
role
model
we
may
not
have
had
everything
that
we
wanted
or
we
d
seen
other
people
have
but
she
made
sure
we
had
the
necessary
things
that
we
needed
and
she
was
always
there
for
us
wanda
says
of
her
mother
in
fact
long
after
wanda
was
on
her
own
her
mother
was
still
being
a
role
model
and
still
being
there
for
her
family
for
she
had
taken
in
the
children
of
wanda
s
deeply
troubled
sister
rather
than
see
them
separated
and
shuffled
off
to
foster
care
there
were
seven
children
but
they
were
family
and
wanda
s
mother
even
though
she
was
getting
on
in
years
was
determined
to
keep
them
together
no
matter
how
difficult
it
would
be
financially
and
then
a
year
ago
this
past
december
disaster
happened
in
a
family
that
didn
t
need
any
more
trouble
wanda
s
mother
passed
away
and
wanda
had
a
decision
to
make
it
was
a
decision
made
with
a
mother
s
heart
rather
than
giving
her
sister
s
children
to
social
services
to
strangers
wanda
chose
to
take
on
the
responsibility
of
raising
them
herself
knowing
full
well
that
the
likelihood
of
her
sister
coming
back
into
the
picture
as
a
fulltime
mother
was
not
a
strong
one
at
all
it
was
a
decision
made
not
only
with
love
but
with
courage
and
the
situation
wanda
then
found
herself
in
bore
that
out
can
you
imagine
trying
to
raise
ten
children
in
a
two
bedroom
apartment
can
you
imagine
what
it
must
be
like
never
mind
the
financial
pressures
of
just
trying
to
live
can
you
see
the
bunkbeds
and
mattresses
on
the
floor
that
put
seven
of
the
kids
as
young
as
two
and
as
old
as
in
the
same
bedroom
or
the
mealtimes
that
have
the
entire
family
trying
to
find
a
place
to
sit
and
balance
their
plates
while
eating
wherever
they
can
find
a
place
or
the
demands
placed
on
one
bathroom
by
a
family
of
eleven
or
the
virtual
impossibility
of
finding
a
quiet
place
to
study
or
even
think
so
that
the
children
can
cope
in
school
and
one
day
have
a
chance
of
achieving
something
better
or
the
seemingly
impossible
task
of
trying
to
keep
such
a
crowded
home
neat
and
clean
well
if
you
can
imagine
these
things
i
know
you
can
imagine
that
even
in
the
atmosphere
of
love
that
wanda
created
the
children
began
to
have
trouble
problems
at
school
and
at
home
began
to
surface
as
the
children
reacted
to
the
pressures
of
their
crowded
living
situation
and
their
emotions
such
as
pain
and
anger
at
having
been
abandoned
by
their
mother
homework
went
undone
fights
began
to
occur
at
home
the
phone
repeatedly
began
to
ring
at
wanda
s
new
job
with
calls
from
school
because
another
of
the
children
was
having
problems
worst
of
all
wanda
had
to
deal
with
this
worsening
problem
as
she
was
trying
to
succeed
at
her
new
job
her
anxiety
level
rose
every
time
the
telephone
rang
but
because
of
the
compassion
and
generosity
shown
by
habitat
partners
like
you
wanda
s
prayers
were
suddenly
answered
she
was
approved
for
a
habitat
house
the
kind
of
miracle
that
people
who
grow
up
in
wanda
s
world
never
seriously
hope
for
let
alone
expect
and
wanda
s
miracle
isn
t
just
the
house
which
will
make
it
possible
for
the
children
to
achieve
some
privacy
and
basic
space
from
one
another
that
will
only
be
the
first
step
toward
healing
the
pain
of
having
been
abandoned
several
times
neglected
and
denied
the
happy
childhood
that
should
be
every
child
s
birthright
as
wanda
explains
they
ve
been
shipped
from
places
from
home
to
home
and
i
think
they
missed
out
on
things
they
shouldn
t
have
like
having
their
birthdays
celebrated
they
didn
t
get
to
do
all
that
and
they
should
mom
was
too
old
to
try
to
do
it
so
i
give
them
that
chance
this
past
year
even
though
it
was
kind
of
hard
we
always
made
sure
they
had
a
birthday
party
and
this
year
was
the
first
time
they
ever
got
to
go
to
the
county
fair
i
m
trying
now
with
counseling
to
get
them
to
get
along
with
each
other
and
to
let
them
go
out
and
be
with
their
friends
and
do
the
stuff
that
i
did
as
a
child
but
i
m
also
trying
to
teach
them
that
they
have
to
earn
what
they
get
and
to
be
part
of
making
sure
their
lives
are
better
that
s
all
i
want
for
them
to
be
better
so
i
can
feel
like
they
re
going
to
accomplish
something
and
be
fine
on
their
own
and
the
first
step
toward
accomplishing
something
of
course
is
learning
that
it
s
possible
growing
up
experiencing
home
ownership
as
a
fact
of
daily
life
knowing
there
s
a
quiet
place
to
study
having
your
friends
over
to
play
without
being
embarrassed
about
where
you
live
but
this
new
awareness
of
life
s
possibilities
isn
t
confined
to
children
by
any
means
the
adults
feel
it
too
especially
the
single
mothers
who
have
accomplished
something
of
extreme
difficulty
changing
their
family
s
economic
prospects
on
their
own
in
a
country
that
still
makes
that
harder
for
a
woman
than
for
a
man
while
still
filling
all
the
roles
that
go
with
the
blessed
title
of
mother
and
as
i
talk
to
women
homeowners
all
over
the
country
i
am
always
mindful
of
how
very
much
they
see
the
habitat
experience
from
exactly
this
perspective
as
mothers
for
each
day
they
see
the
lives
of
their
children
constantly
enriched
by
living
in
a
community
of
people
who
helped
build
their
house
as
others
had
helped
them
is
it
any
wonder
they
go
to
bed
every
night
with
prayers
of
thanks
for
what
is
now
possible
for
their
children
and
you
can
be
sure
that
there
are
also
prayers
of
thanks
in
their
hearts
for
the
people
like
you
who
made
it
possible
wanda
is
as
aware
as
any
mother
can
be
about
the
new
possibilities
you
create
which
she
calls
a
wonderful
thing
to
know
i
told
all
my
friends
about
habitat
and
how
it
works
when
i
hear
them
talk
about
how
they
ll
never
own
their
own
home
i
tell
them
there
s
hope
for
us
that
i
m
living
proof
and
everything
i
ve
prayed
on
every
night
has
been
answered
you
re
a
part
of
those
answered
prayers
that
s
why
i
hope
you
will
take
special
delight
in
knowing
that
on
the
day
wanda
s
new
habitat
house
is
dedicated
your
loving
spirit
will
be
felt
on
that
joyous
occasion
i
hope
you
ll
think
of
wanda
and
other
mothers
prayers
and
dreams
this
mother
s
day
and
more
than
that
i
hope
you
ll
also
think
about
what
it
will
mean
for
them
to
have
a
simple
decent
home
for
their
kids
your
continued
generosity
can
help
change
a
desperate
mother
s
life
and
in
tribute
to
all
of
the
precious
mothers
in
your
own
life

with
self
determination
pursuit
of
excellence
and
a
love
affair
with
skiing
miyares
went
from
a
bumbling
beginner
on
the
bunny
low
and
slow
beginner
slope
to
exceeding
miles
per
hour
to
rank
as
the
number
one
b
totally

in

his

disabled

award
and
the
and
u
s
national
disabled
alpine
ski
championships
no
decision
since
his
decision
to
return
to
the
field
during
the
vietnam
war
had
as
much
impact
on
miyares
however
in
returning
to
the
field
wasn
t
entirely
voluntary
the
army
s
answer
to
sgt
miyares
repeated
trips
to
sick
call
basically
boiled
down
to
get
your
act
together
and
get
back
in
the
field
or
we
ll
make
you
a
private
again
sergeant
the
message
we
clear
the
army
suspected
him
of
malingering
and
that
didn
t
sit
well
with
the
th
infantry
division
platoon
sergeant
miyares
geared
up
and
moved
to
the
field
with
his
troops
the
blurred
vision
sever
stomach
cramps
headaches
constant
fatigue
and
vomiting
would
have
to
take
a
back
seat
to
the
war
his
platoon
came
under
attack
in
the
field
miyares
heard
explosions
thought
they
were
mortars
and
collapsed
two
days
later
he
emerged
from
a
diabetic
coma
in
a
saigon
hospital
miyares
spent
the
next
four
months
in
hospitals
in
japan
and
the
u
s
before
being
medically
discharged
from
the
army
with
as
service
connected
disability
for
diabetes
the
army
had
been
right
the
sergeant
became
a
private
a
private
citizen
fighting
a
new
war
against
diabetes
but
miyares
wasn
t
alone
he
had
an
ally
joann
was
by
his
side
the
moment
he
returned
home
when
urban
left
for
vietnam
we
d
only
been
married
a
short
time
joann
said
when
he
came
home
it
was
harder
controlling
diabetes
we
didn
t
know
as
much
about
it
as
we
do
today
and
were
learning
and
adjusting
to
diabetes
at
the
same
time
we
were
building
our
marriage
we
had
our
ups
and
downs
in
those
days
but
urban
is
very
self
determined
and
motivated
and
we
got
through
it
when
our
son
urban
paul
was
born
urban
was
a
really
good
father
he
liked
to
do
little
league
and
soccer
with
him
and
we
did
all
the
things
families
do
but
if
daddy
wasn
t
feeling
good
our
son
knew
it
was
because
daddy
was
a
diabetic
when
children
are
younger
they
don
t
always
understand
what
that
means
but
as
our
son
grew
he
understood
more
and
more
when
urban
became
blind
our
son
was
very
understanding
of
it
and
at
he
s
adjusted
very
well
to
all
that
s
happened
whenever
we
need
him
he
s
there
landing
meaningful
and
productive
employment
was
hard
for
miyares
he
became
so
frustrated
with
available
jobs
that
he
went
into
business
for
himself
in
he
opened
is
first
business
a
small
new
jersey
construction
firm
it
didn
t
last
very
long
but
miyares
discovered
he
loved
being
a
businessman
he
had
an
appetite
and
aptitude
for
business
he
moved
on
to
open
his
own
retail
stores
restaurants
sales
organizations
a
manufacturing
company
and
a
public
relations
firm
business
ventures
led
him
from
coast
to
coast
gaining
experience
along
the
way
after
his
blindness
miyares
couldn
t
find
resources
for
a
blind
businessman
they
tried
tremendously
to
help
me
at
the
blind
rehabilitation
center
but
the
only
resources
for
a
businessperson
were
for
the
non
disabled
and
non
blind
miyares
said
the
more
i
searched
for
resources
and
assistance
to
benefit
a
blind
businessperson
the
more
i
couldn
t
find
any
i
took
business
courses
but
again
they
were
slanted
toward
the
non
disabled
employer
or
employee
at
that
point
i
knew
that
if
people
who
are
disabled
are
to
compete
in
this
world
and
be
productive
we
have
to
compete
on
a
non
disabled
basis
i
also
knew
we
couldn
t
do
it
without
information
and
assistance
when
i
tried
to
get
answers
to
my
questions
i
got
nothing
not
even
encouragement
or
advice
what
i
got
a
lot
of
was
sorry
and
blind
people
can
t
do
that
i
became
so
frustrated
in
i
made
a
business
of
helping
disabled
veterans
i
chose
disabled
veterans
because
that
s
what
i
am
i
knew
a
lot
of
disabled
veterans
some
were
in
business
and
some
were
talking
about
starting
a
business
i
started
offering
free
consulting
advice
and
helped
people
the
first
year
business
to
business
assistance
the
business
grew
and
eventually
he
was
helping
thousands
nationwide
miyares

the
business
to
include
all
disabled

drastically
in
terms
of
joint
research
projects
on
medical
imaging
computational
neuroscience
and
biomechanics
and
the
partnership
with
naval
avionics
warfare
center
and
naval
weapons
center
flourished
with
the
moving
of
electronic
manufacturing
productivity
facility
from
california
to
a
new
facility
within
one
mile
of
the
main
campus
since
the
beginning
of
our
annual
fund
in
alumni
have
been
important
partners
in
the
development
of
our
programs
in
september
we
will
begin
our
annual
telefund
gifts
received
will
be
used
in
various
ways
our
school
is
continually
challenged
to
provide
state
of
the
art
training
for
its
students
in
order
to
do
this
laboratories
must
be
developed
and
maintained
with
equipment
that
will
provide
first
rate
hands
on
experience
for
our
students
also
there
is
the
area
of
student
support
the
departments
and
programs
within
the
school
of
engineering
and
technology
provide
thousands
of
dollars
of
scholarship
support
each
year
to
students
still
there
is
great
need
especially
in
the
way
of
endowed
scholarships
these
funds
would
insure
that
scholarships
are
available
to
students
as
long
as
there
are
students
to
support
i
am
confident
that
as
a
proud
graduate
of
our
school
you
will
participate
in
supporting
our
telefund
and
extend
the
promise
of
purdue
programs
at
indianapolis
to
many
new
students

dear
name
you
may
remember
bumping
into
me
somewhere
along
your
path
through
college
i
have
been
with
the
department
of
manufacturing
technology
for
about
thirty
years
twenty
five
years
as
chairman
and
have
recently
retired
as
i
recall
i
ve
never
asked
you
for
a
contribution
until
now
at
the
last
honors
convocation
the
faculty
established
a
scholarship
award
in
my
name
to
honor
an
outstanding
student
from
our
department
i
was
moved
excited
and
very
surprised
by
this
gesture
from
the
faculty
who
funded
this
award
from
their
pockets
george
f
badger
the
recipient
of
the
award
was
equally
surprised
not
to
mention
a
little
better
off
financially
i
am
concerned
however
about
the
plans
that
exist
for
continuing
this
award
in
the
future
the
intent
is
that
the
faculty
will
contribute
to
the
award
annually
unfortunately
times
and
members
of
the
faculty
change
but
the
need
for
our
students
to
receive
scholarship
awards
will
continue
at
an
unprecedented
rate
as
i
see
it
this
can
only
be
done
through
the
establishment
of
a
scholarship
fund
which
will
generate
sufficient
income
to
support
this
award
i
hope
you
will
join
me
in
supporting
this
scholarship
opportunity
by
sending
your
check
today
made
payable
to
the
peale
scholarship
fund
i
hope
this
letter
finds
you
and
your
family
in
good
health
i
am
always
happy
to
hear
from
you
about
your
accomplishments
career
family

as
members
of
your
graduating
class
we
appreciate
the
hard
work
that
has
made
your
degree
possible
not
only
have
many
of
our
class
juggled
family
and
job
responsibilities
with
studies
but
they
also
have
made
time
to
participate
in
student
activities
which
have
become
traditions
in
our
school
for
example
those
in
met
who
worked
on
team
indy
were
among
the
first
indianapolis
campus
participants
in
the
annual
purdue
grand
prix
at

others
who

s
super
mileage
vehicle
with
rhllv
s
baker
s
club

s
other
activities
helped
to
maintain
traditions
in
their
departments
that
future
classes
will
be
encouraged
to
continue
these
activities
have
helped
develop
a
sense
of
community
that
enabled
everyone
to
endure
and
succeed
even
in
difficult
times
even
if
we
have
not
engaged
in
formal
extracurricular
activities
however
many
more
of
us
have
helped
each
other
by
reviewing
homework
problems
in
one
of
the
student
lounges
by
participating
in
group
projects
in
classes
meeting
sometimes
after
class
hours
by
taking
time
to
listen
to
a
classmate
s
personal
problems
or
just
by
socializing
between
classes
as
graduates
of
the
class
of
we
would
like
to
leave
behind
something
tangible
in
appreciation
for
the
support
and
encouragement
we
have
received
from
other
students
in
the
school
of
engineering
and
technology
to
do
this
we
are
initiating
another
tradition
senior
challenge
senior
challenge
is
an
opportunity
for
us
to
contribute
to
the
school
that
has
given
us
the
tools
to
enrich
our
lives
and
make
our
dreams
come
true

goal
for
senior
challenge
is
to
raise
funds
to
purchase
furnishings
for
the
student
lounges
in
the
et
building
and
in
the
new
building
that
will
house
computer
technology
and
engineering
programs
at
one
time
or
another
we
have
all
met
classmates
in
the
lounges
in
the
et
building
or
the
administration
building
at
the
th
street
campus
we
all
realize
how
the
availability
or
lack
of
comfortable
seating
and
conference
space
made
it
possible
for
us
to
socialize
or
to
get
help
in
a
course
giving
us
difficulty
lounges
newly
furnished
through
senior
challenge
will
promote
teamwork
in
the
school
by
allowing
future
classes
to
benefit
from
each
others
friendship
and
assistance
with
this
goal
the
real
beneficiaries
of
our
class
gift
will
be
the
students
who
follow
us
as
our
senior
year
draws
to
a
close
we
challenge
you
to
participate
in
this
worthy
project
by
making
a
contribution
or
a
pledge
using
the

a
positive
finishing
touch
on

graduating
year

i
am
pleased
to
have
survived
nearly
five
months
as
geology
s
new
chairman
it
has
been
a
busy
time
for
we
have
an
ambitious
agenda
for
growth
and
development
among
our
objectives
for
the
year
are
increasing
enrollments
re
evaluating
both
our
undergraduate
program
and
our
graduate
program
better
coordinating
our
curricula
at
all
levels
developing
and
promoting
new
courses
increasing
communication
with
current
students
and
alumni
and
establishing
beneficial
outside
contacts
much
of
our
effort
is
focusing
upon
the
strengthening
of
our
environmental
programs
dr
mirsky
is
retiring
as
a
faculty
member
in
may
and
dean
stocum
has
authorized
the
hiring
of
two
new
assistant
professors
both
new
faculty
will
have
credentials
in
the
environmental
field
to
have
achieved
this
commitment
from
the
dean
means
our
new
efforts
have
already
impressed
him
and
we
intend
to
keep
his
attention
the
whole
country
will
know
about
us
this
spring
the
department
will
host
a
symposium
on
dinosaurs
ding
fest
march
virtually
every
expert
on
dinosaurs
in
the
whole
u
s
a
will
be
here
however
our
major
emphasis
is
on
involving
students
of
all
ages
the
event
will
be
big
contact
dr

we
are

will
be
even
more
proud
of
your
department
than
you

however
continues
to
need
your
financial
assistance
our
budget
has
been
cut
nearly
versus
a
year
ago
operating
costs
are
mounting
and
it
costs
money
to
grow
we
have
many
needs
both
for
the
overall
operation
of
the
department
and
for
special
programs
like
ding
fest
contributions
to
ding
fest
are
especially
important
because
we
believe
that
our
initial
investment
will
result
in
substantial
earnings
for
the
department
also
contributions
to
ding
fest
will
make
its
activities
more
affordable
to
students
as
in
the
past
you
can
also
contribute
directly
to
the

scholarship
fund
i
urge
you

dynamic
growth
this

please
send

so
we
can

here
at

in

late
last
spring
we
established
an
account
for
the
iggs
scholarship
to
help
defray
the
tuition
costs
for
an
undergraduate
major
in

at

as
i
explained
at

meeting
i
hoped
that
eventually
the

fund
would
have
a
principal
of
so
that
the
interest
would
cover
the
complete
costs
for
a
student
for
one
year
the
account
now
has
about
there
are
several
ways
that
we
can
reach
the
balance
of
our
target
principal
the
simplest
is
for
one
or
more
of
the
members
to
simply
donate
one
million
dollars
to
the
iggs
scholarship
fund
if
because
of
the
depressed
stock
market
your
assets
are
not
liquid
enough
for
you
to
come
up
with
one
million
dollars
this
year
then
we
can
consider
one
of
the
other
alternate
ways
to
achieve
our
goal
one
alternate
is
for
you
and
each
of
the
friends
of
iggs
on
my
mailing
list
to
contribute
to
the
scholarship
fund
and
our
goal
will
be
reached
immediately
another
alternate
way
to
reach
our
scholarship
goal
is
for
everyone
to
contribute
as
much
as
he
or
she
can
this
year
and
each
year
for
the
near
future
and
sooner
or
later
the
goal
will
be
attained
let
me
assure
you
that
we
would
appreciate
receiving
one
million
dollars
from
you
but
let
me
also
assure
you
that
we
would

equally
well
the
contribution
you

dear
herron
student
family
perhaps
you
have
heard
your
student
talk
about
the
visiting
artists
who
present
slide
lectures
at
herron
about
their
work
sit
in
on
classes
and
mingle
with
the
students
some
six
artists
visit
herron
each
year
from
allover
the
country
these
are
artists
who
are
either
emerging
as
leaders
in
their
fields
or
who
have
already
become
well
known
the
visiting
artists
program
is
a
critical
component
of
the
herron
curriculum
as
it
exposes
the
students
to
artists
who
are
successfully
supporting
themselves
with
their
art
and
to
the
most
current
art
trends
outside
of
indiana
each
year
funding
is
sought
through
grants
and
gifts
from
individuals
grants
are
becoming
harder
to
secure
and
we
must
look
to
the
generosity
of
individuals
to
sustain
the
program
the
funding
covers
transportation
lodging
and
lecture
fees
for
the
artists
and
publicity
in
total
the
program
costs
about
per
year
i
am
asking
for
the
support
of
the
families
of
herron
students
to
help
maintain
this
vital
program
we
feel
that
it
is
of
great
importance
to
the
curriculum
and
helps
to
broaden
your
student
s
herron
experience
simply
fill
out
the
enclosed
form
and
return
it
with
your
donation
to
herron
all
checks
should
be
made
payable

any
gift
will
be
greatly
appreciated

discretionary
funds
are
especially
needed
to
attract
and
retain
faculty
members
during
the
s
there
will
be
much
stiffer
national
competition
for
new
faculty
the
numbers
of
ph
d
holders
will
be
down
many
current
faculty
will
retire
and
enrollments
will
increase
at
iupui
where
we
continue
to
face
critical
shortages
of
full
time
faculty
we
will
have
to
make
special
efforts
gifts

will
help
pay
travel
costs
to
our
city
and

for
prospective
faculty
and

some
relocation
costs
the
chancellor
s
circle
also
will
help
current
faculty
keep
up
with
their
scholarly
and
professional
peers
they
need
individual
support
to
attend
conferences
present
papers
publish
their
works
and
keep
in
touch
with
others
in
their
fields
across
the
country
faculty
and
student
awards
annual
presentations
of
chancellor
s
awards
encourage
outstanding
work
among
faculty
staff
and
students
these
awards
provide
chances
to
recognize
unusual
achievements
and
sometimes
offer
honoraria
as
incentives
the
chancellor

circle
will
help
to
defray
costs
of
these
special
awards
special
opportunities
no
organization
can
anticipate
every
opportunity
that
may
become
available
during
its
next
budget
cycle
these
can
include
unforeseen
chances
to
enhance
student
and
faculty
learning
by
inviting
special
visitors
and
scholars
to
the
campus
when
they
happen
to
be
in
the
state
sometimes
local
events
can
generate
chances
for
faculty
and
staff
to
assist
the
community
because
of
their
unique
forms
of
expertise
or
sudden
changes
in
other
countries
can
create
openings

faculty
research
the

september

city
st

dear
mr
name
the
space
age
began
with
the
launch
of
sputnik
in
october
this
remarkable
accomplishment
happened
during
the
first
semester
of
my
junior
year
at
depauw
university
where
by
sheer
coincidence
i
was
being
severely
challenged
by
an
introduction
to
classical
mechanics
where
i
was
studying
the
equations
of
gravity
and
orbital
motion
as
taught
by
dr
correll
believe
me
i
never
dreamed
that
some
years
later
my
life
would
depend
on
my
precise
understanding
of
real
time
solutions
to
these
same
equations
had
i
known
such
strange
events
would
occur
i
assure
you
i
would
have
spent
much
more
time
studying
physics
in
minshall
lab
and
less
time
playing
bridge
in
the
hub
the
point
is
the
liberal
arts
education
you
and
i
received
at
depauw
gave
us
the
tools
to
learn
and
i
m
convinced
instilled
in
us
the
curiosity
to
keep
learning
in
our
changing
world
the
sky
is
no
longer
the
boundary
to
our
travels
in
our
changing
world
there
are
likewise
no
boundaries
to
where
a
depauw
education
can
lead
us
that
s
why
i
m
writing
to
you
and
asking
for
your
help
in
this
year
s
annual
fund
why
should
we
support
depauw
simply
stated
we
must
offer
the
students
now
enrolled
at
the
university
those
same
opportunities
to
develop
skills
they
will
need
to
meet
ever
moving
challenges
through
our
support
of
the
annual
fund
you
and
i
can
help
continue
the
educational
tradition
we
enjoyed
a
strong
foundation
for
a
lifetime
of
continued
learning
and
growth
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
pop
quizzes
my
dad
professor
perk
allen
gave
his
accounting
students
served
an
important
purpose
his
lesson
of
be
prepared
real
life
will
test
you
every
day
was
carried
by
each
of
his
students
into
their
individual
careers
it
is
practical
advice
that
remains
true
today
is
a
liberal
arts
education
still
sufficient
some
argue
that
the
growing
pace
of
technology
makes
a
liberal
arts
education
less
valuable
in
the
s
i
believe
just
the
opposite
a
liberal
arts
education
is
even
more
valuable
today
precisely
because
technology
outdates
itself
so
rapidly
the
ability
to
keep
learning
to
keep
discovering
and
to
keep
inventing
becomes
even
more
important
if
we
are
to
compete
in
tomorrow
s
world
for
example
when
i
was
at
depauw
the
most
technical
educational
experience
i
can
remember
was
visiting
the
ibm
plant
east
of
greencastle
to
observe
the
manufacture
of
computer
cards
this
was
the
future
yet
those
cards
quickly
became
obsolete
as
computers
shrank
in
size
and
new
data
handling
technologies
were
invented
today
we
can
readily
buy
lap
top
computers
with
data
storage
capacity
far
greater
than
that
entire
ibm
factory
could
have
offered
yes
as
a
science
student
at
depauw
i
did
learn
the
methods
of
mathematics
and
the
mechanics
of
physics
more
importantly
i
remember
that
professors
like
dr
gass
and
dr
cook
also
taught
us
to
persevere
in
the
face
of
occasional
failures
and
instilled
in
us
the
confidence
to
tackle
complicated
sounding
subjects
subjects
which
might
be
difficult
to
learn
but
which
could
yield
great
rewards
and
coaches
like
mike
snavely
and
charlie
erdmann
taught
us
about
the
importance
of
teamwork
not
only
on
the
playing
field
but
in
the
classroom
and
in
the
dormitories
fraternities
and
sororities
during
the
course
of
our
daily
lives
as
undergraduates
your
memories
are
probably
very
similar
regardless
of
when
you
studied
in
greencastle
the
fact
is
that
the
only
way
we
can
keep
up
with
changes
of
today
s
world
is
to
possess
the
energy
and
the
ability
to
continue
learning
through
some
years
so
far
my
depauw
education
hasn
t
let
me
down
the
challenges
i
face
today
in
applying
new
technology
in
the
manufacturing
of
low
cost
space
products
depend
upon
my
ability
to
keep
learning
believe
it
or
not
the
wondrous
sputnik
satellite
of
compares
to
a
s
communications
satellite
as
those
obsolete
ibm
computer
cards
compare
to
modern
disk
storage
units
you
have
your
own
special
memories
and
reasons
to
support
depauw
but
we
are
all
members
of
the
depauw
family
of
friends
classmates
and
special
professors
my
closeness
to
the
university
is
strengthened
by
a
family
legacy
which
goes
back
over
years
to
my
great
great
grandfather
professor
william
f
swahlen
who
taught
greek
at
indiana
asbury

dear
name
here
we
are
the
department
of
communication
and
theatre
and
there
you
are
an
alum
of
the
department
yet
in
the
midst
of
all
our
activity
over
the
years
many
of
us
have
not
communicated
at
least
not
with
one
another
under
separate
cover
dr
bruce
wagener
recently
sent
a
mailing
to
you
in
order
to
confirm
your
current
educational
and
occupational
status
your
ongoing
involvements
and
interests
and
future
plans
you
might
have
our
records
in
that
regard
are
fragmentary
at
best
most
recently
we
received
results
of
an
employment
survey
of
graduates
conducted
by
iupui
s
career
and
employment
services
it
was
pleasing
to
learn
that
we
had
nearly
twice
as
many
graduates
as
any
other
department
in
the
school
of
liberal
arts
a
proportionately
large
number
of
you
responded
to
that
survey
but
it
is
high
time
that
we
establish
direct
contact
with
all
alumni
from
all
the
graduation
years
from
all
department
activities
and
areas
that
is
why
as
dr
wagener
indicated
departmental
newsletters
soon
will
be
forthcoming
sharing
information
on
alumni
as
well
as
happenings
in
the
department
recently
a
project
arose
that
should
be
interesting
to
you
as
a
former
student
who
struggled
to
clear
the
financial
hurdle
of
education
we
were
generously
offered
toward
the
establishment
of
our
department
s
first
scholarship
program
it
was
given
as
a
start
toward
a
goal
of
a
alumni
scholarship
fund
that
fund
would
allow
us
to
grant
a
scholarship
annually
to
meritorious
applicants
with
financial
need
here
is
where
you
can
help
the
is
a
highly
commendable
goal
which
can
be
realized
through
contributions
in
whatever
amount
you
can
give
as
you
probably
well
know
the
resources
provided
by
such
scholarships
might
well
determine
whether
or
not
promising
students
can
continue
their
education
please
use
the
enclosed
postage
paid
envelope
to
make
your
gift
i
might
add
that
a
gift
of
qualifies
you
for
recognition
in
the
school
of
liberal
arts
dean
s
council
a
critical
group
of
supporters
whose
generosity
does
a
lot
to
advance
the
calibre
of
the
school
whether
the
tax
deductible
gift
you
can
give
is
for
or
or

you
to
join
us

dear

you
never
write
you
never
call
just
off
on
your
own
adventure
with
never
a
thought
about
us
but
we
re
here
and
doing
our
best
to
enhance
the
value
of
your
degree
iupui
is
growing
and
so
is
the
english
department
so
we
thought
you
ought
to
know
what
we
ve
been
doing
much
of
our
energy
lately
has
been
devoted
to
preparing
the
proposal
for
a
master
s
degree
in
english
the
proposal
is
now
before
the
commission
for
higher
education
and
if
they
pass
it
this
fall
we
should
be
open
for
business
with
our
new
ma
program
in
fall
semester
keep
an
eye
out
for
our
announcement
and
we
made
some
extensive
changes
in
the
requirements
for
the
english
major
the
new
requirements
stress
closer
attention
to
individual
learning
between
students
and
advisers
and
emphasize
the
connections
among
literary
study
writing
and
linguistics
we
still
want
our
students
to
take
survey
courses
shakespeare
and
advanced
expository
writing
but
we
have
a
different
mechanism
for
going
about
making
it
happen
we
ve
also
added
a
number
of
new
faculty
and
some
of
the
old
timers
have
developed
new
research
and
teaching
interests
and
you
what
have
you
been
up
to
write
and
let
us
know
what
you
are
doing
and
how
you
are
faring
in
the
journey
of
life
from
time
to
time
we
d
like
to
send
out
a
modest
newsletter
that
keeps
you
up
to
date
on
us
and
on
you
you
can
omit
any
of
the
illegal
or
embarrassing
activities
if
you
like
but
other
graduates
will
be
interested
in
your
news
and
we
will
share
with
you
our
news
we
ve
been
looking
for
ways
to
build
a
sense
of
community
among
our
majors
our
faculty
and
our
graduates
english
types
like
us
thrive
in
an
environment
that
fosters
dialogue
this
is
sometimes
difficult
if
not
impossible
at
a
campus
like
ours
yet
all
of
us
seek
in
some
ways
to
make
it
happen
one
of
the
department
s
initiatives
is
to
offer
support
for
english
majors
through
the
development
of
scholarship
funds
in
fact
this
is
such
an
important
issue
every
one
of
the
full
time
faculty
and
many
of
the
adjunct
faculty
make
at
least
one
significant
gift
to
the
department
every
year
faculty
can
be
a
pretty
serious
force
when
they
believe
in
the
rightness
of
something
like
this
to
date
over
has
been
given
to
scholarships
or
other
awards
for
english
majors
by
a
wide
variety
of
donors
we
now
administer
two
annual
prizes
for
creative
writing
a
fund
for
bringing
writers
to
campus
and
two
competitive
scholarship
funds
a
number
of
your
fellow
alumni
have
expressed
an
interest
in
establishing
an
english
alumni
scholarship
fund
to
offer
tuition
support
to
an
english
major
who
promises
to
make
a
contribution
to
life
after
graduating
we
can
support
such
a
scholarship
if
you
will
give
to
the
english
alumni
scholarship
fund
if
every
english
graduate
takes
this
opportunity
to
pass
along
the
gifts
they
have
received
then
in
a
few
years
we
can
offer
scholarships
to
a
number
of
worthy
undergraduates
so
fill
out
the

in

society
and
of
the
challenge
we
have
in
making
it
available
to
a
wide
range
of
students
with
the
cost
of
providing
quality
and
diversity
always
on
the
rise
the
financial
generosity
of

and

continues
to
allow
important
nationally
recognized
projects
to
move
forward
projects
which
enliven

draw
some

i
believe
you
know
first
hand
how
important
it
was
that
liberal

was
open

available

you
also
know
how
important
it
still
is
you
may
not
have
realized
it
at

you

your

were
part
of
something
very
big
in
indianapolis
today
the
school

experiences
national
prominence
as
a
focal
point
for
innovation
in
our
humanities

of
the
interdisciplinary

developed

progressing
well

the

essential
aspects
of
initiating
all
these
projects
as

however
the

has
received
a
gift
to
begin
a

very
generous

in

to
preserve
a

it

especially
appealing

the
fact
that
a

match
their
gifts
sometimes
as
much
as
three
to
one
if
you
do
and
you
make
a

your

match
could
raise
the

these
are
challenging
times
for
public
institutions
of
higher
education
with
legislative
appropriations
unable
to
fund
schools
to
the
level
they
have
in
the
past
the
iu
school
of
dentistry
is
limited
in
these
times
because
it
is
impractical
to
raise
tuition
and
fees
sufficiently
to
offset
lost
state
appropriations
i
hope
you
have
read
in
the

how
our

has
taken
aggressive

to
streamline

incurring

the

has
limited
ability
to
provide
scholarship
money
to
deserving
students
who
otherwise
might
choose
another
career
option
because
of
educational
expense
private
support
is
needed
to
offset
this
problem
additionally
there
is
a
tremendous
need
to
upgrade
the
technological
infrastructure
of
the
school
our
faculty
and

need
support
to
be
able
to
keep
up
with
rapid

will
be
equipped
with
the
newest
dental
units
and
systems
available
the
money
to

hopefully
recovered
with

next
few
years
however

august
dear

of

time
of

if
you
have
not
please
call
the
iu
alumni
association
right
away
our
class
along
with
other
reunion
classes
has
been
challenged
to
support
a
program
which
will
directly
benefit
iusd
students
remember
the
student
lounge
which
we
enjoyed
so
much
where
we
played
euchre
with
some
of
our
teachers
healy
boyd
buck
humphries
boesinger
and
others
where
some
ate
their
lunches
and
some
even
studied
well
the
student
lounge
today
is
much
larger
and
in
a
different
location
and
it
badly
needs
upgrading
so
that
it
can
be
a
more
comfortable
place
for
students
to
break
the
tension
of
their
heavy
academic
load
much
heavier
than
what
we
experienced
together
i
think
we
can
make
a
contribution
to
that
upgrading
of
the
lounge
which
will
be
very
meaningful
for
the
students
i
have
sent
a
check
for
and
hope
that
you
will
consider
a
like
gift
or
more
by
the
way
it
must
have
been
years
ago
or
more
when
i
was
a
member
of
the
faculty
that
the
dean
told
me
they
were
going
to
refurnish
our
old
student
lounge
and
asked
if
i
would
like
to
have
one
of
the
old
octagon
shaped
oak
tables
they
were
pretty
beat
up
and
the
tops
well
covered
with
carvings
of
teeth
initials
etc
he
said
that
i
might
midnite
requisition
one
well
i
did
and
sometime
later
removed
it
to
my
cottage
in
canada
and
used
decopor
a
thick
clear
glazed
resin
on
the
top
i
think
it
is
preserved
forever
anyway
i
treasure
that
table
someone
carved
expertly
on
it
a
well
carved
c
f
pope
appears
on
it
as
does
bob
bergman
also
carved
on
the
top
are
the
greek
letters
of
all
three
fraternities
it
s
obvious
from
the
beautiful
carvings
of
teeth
on
the
surface
that
we
had
a
good
instruction
in
dental
anatomy
someone
made
it
possible
for
us
to
have
the
benefit
of
that
lounge
which
i
m
sure
you
can
all
still
picture
in
your
minds
by
contributing
to
the
upgrading
of
today
s
student
lounge
we
have
the
opportunity
to
in
a
small
way
provide
a
part
of
the
memories
of
iu
that
will
last
a
lifetime
you
may
recall
from
my
earlier
letter
regarding
our
th
reunion
that
a
room
in
the
union
building
has
been
reserved
for
our
use
following
the
banquet
on
friday
a
bartender
will
be
available
and
we
will
have
a
chance
to
enjoy
reminiscing
the
equivalent
of
our
four
academic
years
together
and
the
happenings
during
the
time
that
has
transpired
since
our

would
encourage

dental
hygiene
students
at

are
incurring
more
and
more
debt
as
they
progress
through

the
school
of
dentistry
has
limited
ability
to
provide
scholarship
money
to
deserving
students
who
otherwise
might
choose
another
career
option
because
of
educational
expense
the
a
rebekah
fisk

scholarship
enables
the
dental
hygiene
program
to
provide
financial
assistance
to
students
so
that
they
can
concentrate
on
their
education
while
in
school
last
year
we
were
able
to
award
six
scholarships
to
students
in
our
dental
hygiene
program
these
scholarships
were
made
possible
through
contributions
from
alumni
and
friends
of
the

the
a
rebekah
fisk
memorial
scholarship
fund
is
a
priority
for

i
hope
that
you
will
help
us
to
help
students
by
making
a
tax

gift
this

all
contributions
are
very
important

with
your

role
enabling

of
the

dental

are
several
critical
areas
which
cannot

our

cannot
completely
fulfill

the

in
the
past
have

about

are
challenging
times

school
of
dentistry
june
dear
colleague
several
school
of
dentistry
faculty
and
staff
members
have
recently
asked
how
they
can
become
members
of
the
century
club
the
club
is
made
up
of
alumni
faculty
staff
and
friends
who
support
the
school
with
annual
gifts
of
or
more
i
believe
many
of
the
questions
are
being
asked
because
the
campaign
for
indiana
iu
s
major
fundraising
effort
that
started
in
is
ending
and
many
who
supported
iusd
through
the
campaign
are
wondering
how
they
can
continue
their
support
payroll
deduction
is
perhaps
the
easiest
way
to
make
a
contribution
for
example
with
a
biweekly
or
monthly
contributon
a
person
can
be
a
century
club
member
and
if
a
person
decides
to
be
a
contributor
the
best
time
to
begin
is
the
month
prior
to
salary
increases
this
allows
donors
to
adjust
their
budget
without
losing
any
money
they
are
already
receiving
i
guess
i
encourage
this
method
because
i
ve
always
made
my
contributions
this
way
it
s
a
painless
method
and
at
tax
time
i
enjoy
the
deduction
in
we
had
century
i
and
century
ii

we
would
like
to
have
members

the
end

would
like
to

it

all

behavior
although
we
did
have
the

just
in
case
at
the
dinner
on
wednesday
evening
a
special
project
was
announced

you
will
find
exciting

are
establishing
an

of
the
former

of
the
department
dr

have
benefited
all

this
is
a
way
we
can
show
our
appreciation
in
a
tangible
way
the
purpose

given
us
all
so
much
when

were
in
dallas

talked
about
the
good
and
of

bad
times
we
had

agreed

dear
dr

dentistry
has
been
a
part
of
my
life
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
my
sister
is
a
practicing
hygienist
my
brother
a
certified
dental
technician
and
my
father
has
been
both
a
general
practitioner
and
dental
educator
it
was
all
of
those
positive
influences
that
i
have
to
thank
for
opening
my
eyes
to
dentistry
as
a
profession
being
a
third
year
student
and
having
just
escaped
crown
and
bridge
lab
and
the
rest
of
the
second
year
in
one
exhausted
piece
i
have
just
now
begun
to
put
two
years
of
learning
into
daily
clinical
practice
it
has
become
obvious
to
me
already
how
crucial
the
latest
techniques
and
materials
are
to
all
fields
of
dentistry
not
only
are
the
latest
and
best
techniques
important
to
delivering
quality
dental
care
they
also
help
to
preserve
the
traditional
quality
of
dental
education
offered
by
iu
unfortunately
these
improvements
are
costly
so
additional
funds
are
necessary
i
m
sure
that
stepping
into
private
practice
for
the
first
time
will
be
intimidating
enough
but
doing
so
without
the
best
training
possible
would
be
twice
as
stressful
that
is
why
it
is
essential
to
the
students
at
iusd
that
you
continue
your
annual
gift
of
or
more
as
a
century
ii
fellow
support
at
this
level

assisting
the
dental

in
a

of
ways
we
look
forward
to
your
renewal
as
a
century
ii
fellow
on
behalf
of
all
iusd
students
i
would
like
to
personally
thank
you
for
your
past
support
of
dental
education
as
i
have
learned
from
the
three
members
of
my
family
who
have
already
earned
degrees
from
the
school
of
dentistry
the
quality
of
my
education
will
have
a
direct
bearing
on
my
professional
life
for
years
to
come

you
for
helping

dear

very
few
dentists
will
deny
that
indiana
is
lacking
in
qualified
well
trained
dental
assistants
indiana
university
school
of
dentistry
s
program
for
dental
assisting
is
one
of
the
most
outstanding
in
the
state
yet
a
few
years
ago
it
almost
closed
its
doors
due
to
a
lack
of
applicants
in
the
same
period
programs
like
pci
and
aristotle
have
had
no
problems
filling
their
classrooms
a
recent
survey
of
dental
assistants
showed
many
of
them
would
have
chosen
i
u
s
program
if
they
had
known
it
existed
unfortunately
i
u
s
dental
assisting
program
is
not
listed
in
the
yellow
pages
due
to
a
lack
of
funds
i
u
s
program
is
also
less
expensive
than
competing
programs
who
knows
how
many
people
dropped
their
interest
in
dental
assisting
when
they
heard
the
tuition
costs
at
other
schools
hopefully
all
of
us
can
do
more
internal
marketing
with
our
young
patients
to
encourage
them
to
consider
the
field
of
dental
assisting
we
can
also
offer
scholarships
to
young
people
interested
in
attending
i
u
s
program
don
t
overlook
your
patients
as
potential
students
lastly
mr
danny
dean
can
be
contacted
about
establishing
a
special
endowment
fund
to
help
the
dental
assisting
program
conduct
more
public
relations
and
advertising
and
hopefully
even
list
its
phone
number
in
the
yellow
pages
checks
should
be
made
out
to

sent

learned
that

one
is
staff

faculty
development
resources
for
this
purpose
are
limited

all
recognize
the
need
to

we
do
without

at
the
edge
of
their
village
gardens
that
had
been
abandoned
for
decades
during
the
reconstruction
project
elders
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
not
only
to
teach
hopi
language
and
culture
to
their
children
but
also
to
restore
a
sense
of
balance
and
spiritual
integrity

you
have
been

contributing
annually
to

we
are

for
your

all

this

dear

each

the
graduating
class
traditionally
contributes
a
class
gift
to
the
law
school
sometimes
this
constitutes
an
item
of
remembrance
establishment
of
a
scholarship
or
individual
tax
deductible
donations
due
to
the
current
nature
of
the
economy
and
the
effect
that
it
has
wrought
on
the
legal
employment
situation
we
decided
that
the
latter
course
would
be
most
advantageous
to
the
graduating
student
body
each
of
you
may
contribute
the
amount
that
you
feel
able
to
contribute
and
then
you
may
deduct
for
it
on
your
taxes
moreover
the
total
amount
contributed
by
the
class
may
be
put
to
use
by
the
law
school
where
it
is
most
needed
such
as
the
library
fund
the
clinic
programs
or
monies
for
professional
research
assistants
we
believe
that
this
is
the
best
format
in
which
to
contribute
our
class
gift
since
it
benefits
all
concerned
please
review
the
enclosed
information
and
decide
which

format
would
best
suit

an

you

to

these
are
exceedingly
difficult
times
for
public
higher

for
this
fiscal
year
and
next
the
law

is
required
to
absorb
reductions
in
its

appropriation
and
increased
health
costs
totaling
more
than
moreover
significant
increases
in
state
financial
support
for
public
higher

are
extremely
unlikely
during
the
remainder
of
this
decade
as
a
result
of
the
current
economic
climate
alumni
support
is
more
critical
than
ever
before
we
are
no
longer
a
state
supported
law
school
for
the
state
no
longer
provides
the
great
bulk
of
our
funding
instead
i
believe
we
can
best
be
described
as
a
law
school
that
is
state
assisted
student
tuition
covers
about
half
of
our
operating
revenues
and
gifts
from
alumni
and
friends
provide
the
true
margin
of
excellence
for
our
programs
contributions
to
the
law

s

enable
us
to
increase
our
support

student

and
activities
e
g
moot
court
and
client
counseling
student
researchers
and
stipends
for
faculty
research
projects
to
mention
just
a
few
examples
i
believe
we
do
our
job
well
and
are
continually
strengthening
our
reputation
as
a
first
rate
law
school
we
have
excellent
students
and
a
talented
faculty
who
are
highly
regarded
as
classroom
teachers
and
scholars
we
cannot
entirely
succeed
however
without
the
financial
help
of
our
alumni
i
urge
you
to
support
your
alma

so
that
we

continue
to

dear

during
the
current
period
of
declining
state
funding
for
our
law
school
there
is
one
outstanding
development
in
increasing
numbers
alumni
and
friends
are
providing
the
private
resources
necessary
for
scholarships
faculty
support
and
other
items
which
enrich
the

s
curriculum
related

significant
examples
are
the
trust
agreement
executed
by
judge
sam
rosen
in
in
honor
of
his
friend
and
our
former
dean
bill
foust
more
recently
alumni
have
responded
generously
to
the
special
bruce
townsend
endowed
professorship
campaign
as
more
than
has
now
been
given
or
pledged
have
these
events
put
our
law
school
on
easy
street
by
no
means
they
will
however
together
with
annual
fund
contributions
and
other
gifts
assure
that
students
at
the
school
continue
to
receive
an
excellent
legal
education
so
as
the
end
of
approaches
we
ask
that
you
remember
what
your
law
school
education
has
meant
to
you
and
to
support
the
law
school
annual
fund
consider
the
current
enrollment
picture
at
the
school
and
the
costs
students
bear
today
demand
for
a
legal
education
remains
high
the
school
of
law
in
indianapolis
received
nearly
applications
to
enroll
its
first
year
class
of
students
the
school
s
full

part

students
provide

fees
and

and
for
non

to
meet

payments
and
other
expenses
total
loans
of
the
student
body
each
year
now
exceed
consequently
we
have
approached
the
limit
on
student
tuition
increases
you
are
all
too
familiar
with
indiana
s
budget
pinch
and
the
pressures
on
state
government
to
cut
expenditures
consequently
significant
increases
in
state
financial
support
for
higher
education
is
extremely
unlikely
during
the
remainder
of
this
decade
gifts
from
alumni
and
friends
therefore
are
more
critical
than
ever
they
provide
scholarship
dollars
which
aid
students
and
enable
the
school
to
compete
with
other
public
and
private
law
schools
for
outstanding
young
people
gifts
also
support
student
organizations
such
as
moot
court
supply
library

pay
for
student
research
assistants
and
make

other
necessary
resources
your

legislative

are
either
flat

the
campaign
is

more

the
goal
is
to
get
each

to
commit
to

support
the

precedent
has
been
established
by

it
only
takes
three
quick
easy
steps
to
obtain
a
matching
gift
from
your
or
your
spouse
s
employer
to
enhance
your
donation
to
the
indiana
university
school
of
law
indianapolis
determine
if
the
company
you
or
your
spouse
works
for
has
a
matching
gift
program
through
the
personnel
office
obtain
a
matching
gift
form
again
through
personnel
complete
the
form
and
send
it
along
with
your
gift
to
the
law
school
most
companies
match
at
a
ratio
but
some
companies
match
or
even
take
advantage
of
the
benefit
your
company
provides
by
having
your
gift
matched
for
your
alma
mater
don
t
forget
too
that
in
many
cases
subsidiaries
of
larger
parent
companies
are
also
eligible
and
that
companies
will
sometimes
match
a
gift
retroactively
check
out
these
possibilities
with
your
personnel
office
i
cannot
underestimate
the
importance
of
matching
gifts
to
the
law
school
s
annual
fund
program
in
a
time
of
legislative
budget
cuts
every
dollar
helps
to
fund
student
programs
and
scholarships
in
the
law
school
received
in
matching
gifts
from
companies
in
the
law
school
received
only
in
matching
gifts
from
companies
our
alumni
records
show
that
we
have
graduates
directly
employed
by
matching
gift
companies
we
can
only
guess
the
number
of
spouses
who
work
for
a
matching
gift
company
or
one
of
its
subsidiaries
when
you
make
your
contribution
to
the
law
school
in
please
take
a
moment
to
follow
the
three
easy
steps
listed
above

the

it

an
important
one

we
must
have
both
public

for
this
reason
i
ask
that
you
think
of
your
law
school
in
financial

in
the
same
way
that
you
would
view
private

the

needs
range
from

to
paying

and
from
refurbishing

we

thirty
five
years
is
a
long
time
to
have
been
a
part
of
the
law
school
community
as
a
graduate
i
have
since
witnessed
many
changes
in
both
legal
education
and
the
law
school
an
obvious
change
is
a
physical
one
the
old
maennerchor
building
where
i
and
many
of
you
attended
law
school
no
longer
exists
however
its
history
has
been
maintained
in
the
present
law
school
building
through
the
display
of
its
stained
glass
windows
and
the
old
oak
fireplace
its
history
is
also
recognized
by
the
maennerchor
society
whose
members
are
the
school
s
staunchest
and
most
important
supporters
the
enclosed
brochure
provides
information
on
the
old
law
school
building
the
society
and
the
programs
supported
by
private
funds
as
an
alumnus
and
chairman
of
the
maennerchor
society
my
task
now
is
to
beat
the
drums
for
financial
contributions
of
at
least
from
alumni
and
friends
of
the
school
you
know
that
funding
for
public
higher
education
is
declining
nationwide
our
state
appropriation
is
not
now
nor
has
it
ever
been
sufficient
to
fund
for
example
all
of
the
costs
associated
with
faculty
research
student
programs
scholarships
seminars
guest
speakers
and
the
law
library
the
result
is
that
we
must
think
of
the
law
school
in
financial
terms
as
a
private
institution
we
must
recognize
that
the
school
s
ability
to
provide
a
quality
legal
education
is
dependent
on
our
annual
fund
and
endowment
these
comments
for
better
or
for
worse
are
not
accompanied
by
heartrending
pictures
of
faculty
members
standing
in
bread
lines
nor
with

of

however
the
school
does

quite

somewhat
subtle
which
are

met

because
of
the
school
s
success
the
satisfaction
and
pride
that
you
can
take
in

continues
to
be
enhanced
our
challenge
is
to
maintain
the
tradition
of
our
past
and
to
become
even
stronger
in
the
future
we
cannot
accomplish
this
goal
without

prior

we

on

boards
to
review
their

accordingly
a

also

of

nor

of

the
school
s

appears
quite
professional
and
the

reasonably
fed
however
the
school
does
have
specific
needs
some
quite
visible
and

somewhat
subtle
which
are

met
by

student
tuition
and

any
of
these
include
the
student
lounge
this
area
is
usually
the
first
seen
by
prospective
faculty
and
students
over
twenty
years
of

have
left

in
a
shabby

inconsistent

an
impressive

rehabilitation
costs
are
estimated
to

no
state
dollars
are
available
for

scholarships

this
is
only
about
of
the
total
cost
that
law
students
paid
for
their
legal
education
at
the
school
last
year
it
is
far
less
scholarship
aid
than
is
available
at
most
law
schools
last
year
for
example
the
iu
school
of

bloomington
spent
for
scholarships
from
private
and
public
sources
although
their
student
body
is
somewhat
smaller
than
ours
faculty
salaries
and
research
support
our

school
ranks
last
in

base
salaries
for
full
professors
when
compared
with
salaries
paid
to
full
professors
at
the
eight
other
big
ten
law
schools
the
school
also
lacks
sufficient
funds
to
award
adequate
summer
stipends
to
support
faculty
scholarship
and
to
cover
the
costs
of
student
research
assistants
library
expenditures

our

your
patience
will
not
be
tested
by
commentary
on
the
general
assembly
s
problems
in
providing
more
support
for
higher
education
rather
these
humble
efforts
will
be
directed
to
increasing
private
sector
contributions
one
of
the
selling
points
in
this
fall
s
development
campaign
is
the
level
of
support
given
by
the
school
s
alumni
leaders
and
friends
on
the
alumni
association
board
and
the
board
of

obviously
if
all
members
of
the
two
boards
were
to
pledge
per
year
we
would
be
most
grateful
and
we
would
have
a
great
story
to
tell
however
we
recognize
that
contributions
at
the
maennerchor
society
level
are
not
possible

dear
mr
name
there
is
an
ever
increasing
interest
in
the
study
of
law
but
there
is
also
intense
competition
among
law
schools
to
attract
the
best
and
brightest
students
at
our
law
school
applications
for
admission
increased
by
over
the
previous
year
in
applications
for
admission
increased
an
additional
for
this
year
s
entering
class
we
had
more
than
five
times
the
number
of
applications
for
every
freshman
seat
while
the
numbers
are
impressive
scholarships
often
are
critical
in
recruiting
the
top
students
with
financial
need
having
good
students
is
only
part
of
the
picture
an
outstanding
legal
education
requires
more
than
just
classes
in
case
analysis
and
legal
reasoning
fundamental
lawyering
skills
advocacy
client
counseling
negotiation
legal
research
and
writing
are
vital
several
professional
skills
programs
are
offered
each
year
to
students
our
civil
practice
clinic
has
operated
for
several
years
and
we
recently
added
a
criminal
defense
clinic
the
moot
court
program
and
the
indiana
law
review
are
consistently
popular
with
students
these
programs
are
essential
to
a
quality
legal
education
but
they
require
financial
support
over
and
above
that
provided
by
the
university
private
giving
does
have
a
significant
impact
at
the
law
school
during
more
than
alumni

to
fund
g

their
generosity
produced
to
invest
in
an
endowment
account
in
september
we
were
able
to
award
this
prestigious
scholarship
to
two
deserving

are
among
the
first
of
many

who
will
benefit
from

demonstrated
during
the

there
are
numerous
other
challenges
still
to
be
met
i
cannot
emphasize
enough
how
vital
your
support
is
not
only
in
providing
scholarships
but
also
in
meeting
a
wide
variety
of
needs
ranging
from
purchasing
additional
computer
terminals
to
travel
for
our
moot
court
team
it
takes
a
partnership
of
private
support
and
university
funding
for
the

to
continue
to
grow

role

the

in

however
dramatic
increases

dear

i
need
your
immediate
help
today
to
save
a
tradition
a
uniquely
american
tradition
that
has
flourished
in
this
country
for
hundreds
of
years
a
living
tradition
of
voluntary
action
for
the
public
good
known
as
philanthropy
i
look
to
you
because
you
are
among
the
few
who
have
an
outstanding
commitment
to
philanthropy
a
commitment
based
on
your
personal
conviction
that
the
third
sector
is
essential
to
our
american
way
of
life
and
indeed
it
is
unfortunately
our
view
of
the
importance
of
philanthropy
is
not
shared
by
all
americans
many
see
philanthropy
as
no
more
than
the
grand
gestures
of
the
rich
they
do
not
understand
as
we
do
that
the
museums
parks
hospitals
and
community
organizations
supported
by
philanthropy
are
the
cornerstones
of
our
very
quality
of
life
they
do
not
realize
that
right
now
voluntary
associations
are
helping
to
address
some
of
the
most
troubling
social
issues
of
our
time
including
homelessness
crime
and
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
perhaps
most
important
few
comprehend

the
perpetuation

of
our
diverse
tradition
of
giving
caring

carried
out
every

by
americans
from
all

is
key
to
the
present
and
future
vitality
of
our
nation
evidence
strongly
suggests
that
this
lack
of
understanding
is
undermining
young
people
s
commitment
to
philanthropy
today
which
will
devastate
tomorrow
s
not
for

organizations

and
causes
we
cannot
let
our
rich
philanthropic
heritage
a
vast
sector
that
now
includes
more
than
a
million
organizations
and
a
hundred
million
volunteers
be
placed
in
jeopardy
it
is
critical
that
we
educate
americans
about
the
importance
of
philanthropy
that
we
develop
a
new
generation
of
informed
and
committed
leaders
to
do
all
this
we
need
a
place
where
philanthropy
can
be
explored
by
students
scholars
and
practitioners
as
a
serious
academic
field
this
is
why
the

our
earliest
goal
was
to
permeate
the
intellectual
consciousness
of
the
eight
campuses
of
indiana
university
and
establish
philanthropy
as
a
serious
field
of
study
today
we
have
accomplished
all
this
and
much
more
currently
the
university
lists
more
than
courses
in
philanthropic
studies
that
touch
on
a
wide
range
of
disciplines
including
the
law
sociology
and
the
humanities
we
also
have
a
groundbreaking
master
of
arts
in
philanthropic
studies
program
and
are
developing
a
doctoral
degree
in
the
field
what
s
more
over
professors

other
distinguished
scholars
from

to
enrich
our

of
informed

committed
leaders
in
philanthropy
is
in
fact
one
of

and
better
appreciate
their
work
as
part
of
our
philanthropic
tradition
we
are
well
aware
that
the
ultimate
importance
of
the
study
of
philanthropy
is
found
outside
the
walls
of
the
academy
that
is
why
this
national
initiative
is
now
being
launched
in
six
midwestern
cities
it
is
part
of
the
center
s
effort
to
serve
the
needs
of
communities
directly
by
training
those
who
are
responsible
for
sustaining
philanthropy
at
the
grassroots
this
is
but
one
of
many
projects
we
envision
as
we
work
to
develop
the
next
generation
of
philanthropic
leaders
and
take
the
center
s
core
mission
out
into
communities
across
our
country
because
if
you
and
i
truly
want
to
preserve
philanthropy
as
a
way
of
life
we
must
make
certain
that
americans
everywhere
take
philanthropy
seriously
that
they
talk
about
it
debate
it
challenge
it
and
ultimately
keep
it
alive
as
a
cherished
tradition
but
we
cannot
achieve
this
ambitious
task
alone
we
need
your
support
to
help
us
make
it
all
happen
this
is
why
i
am
counting
on
your
commitment
as
a
charter

of
the
center
on
philanthropy
today
we
are
unique

heralding

is
a
delightful
task
indiana

been
at
the
forefront
of
discovery
on
many
occasions
and
the
school
of
medicine
has
been
a
tremendous
contributor
to
the
reputation
of

indiana
university
enjoys
scientific
investigation
for
the
community
s

is
an
integral
part
of
the
school

s
mission
we
take
seriously
our
immense
responsibility
to
push
the
boundaries
of
knowledge
in
our
pursuit
of
new
treatments
and

for

that

of

in

regard
we

at
the

the
work
by
loren
i
field
ph
d
and
his
colleagues
at
the
school
was
a
cover
story
in
a
recent
issue
of
science
the
preeminent
journal
recognizing
benchmark
research
one
of
the
devastating
consequences
of
heart
disease
is
the
irreparable
damage
it
does
to
the
heart
muscle
when
heart
cells
die
because
of
a
heart
attack
or
another
cause
they
cannot
be
repaired
the
possibility
of
cardiac
regeneration
offers
tremendous
hope
for
the
millions
of
patients
who
have
suffered
grave
damage
to
their
hearts
the
research
published
in
science
gives
evidence
of
progress
by
documenting
the
first
successful
transplantation
of
functional
heart
cells
into
an
animal
model
these
transplanted
cells
line
up
properly
make
the
correct
connections
and
function
just
like
native
heart
cells
thus
the
prospect
of
heart
cell
replacement
rather
than
a
full
heart
transplant
may
be
in
the
foreseeable
future
there
is
still
much
work
to
do
but
naturally
we
are
very
proud
of
dr
field
and
his
colleagues
pioneering
work
cardiovascular

has
been
an
area
of

strength
at

dear
mr
and
mrs
name
i
am
writing
to
thank
you
for
your
past
gifts
to
the
iupui
university
libraries
and
to
ask
you
to
renew
that
support
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
why
your
support
is
important
last
week
an
iupui
student
using
indexing
and
abstracting
tools
in
the
library
found
references
to
articles
which
dealt
precisely
with
the
subject
she
had
chosen
for
her
term
paper
imagine
her
dismay
when
she
discovered
that
the
library
did
not
own
most
of
the
journals
many
of
the
articles
could
be
borrowed
on
inter
library
loan
but
there
was
no
guarantee
that
they
would
be
here
in
time
for
her
to
complete
the
paper
unfortunately
this
is
an
all
too
common
scenario
it
is
one
the
libraries
are
trying
very
hard
to
eliminate
but
the
rapidly
increasing
price
of
materials
makes
the
task
difficult
that
s
why
your
past
generosity
to
the
iupui
libraries
has
been
so
appreciated
your
continued
involvement
is
vital
groundbreaking
for
the
new
library
will
be
this
summer
but
this
wonderful
new
building
with
its
st
century
computer
resources
will
need
the
continued
involvement
of
many
friends
like
you
people
who
understand
that
a
library
is
more
than
bricks
mortar
and
good
architecture
as
you
know
a
library
is
a
living
resource
where
the
cultural
history
the
scientific
discovery
and
the
philosophical
dialogue
of
a
planet
is
gathered
for
active
exploration
and
study
for
the
iupui
university
libraries
to
have
collections
access
and
services
which
meet
your
expectations
requires
friends
and
partners
both
inside
the
university
and
throughout
the
community
state
and
nation
with
your
assistance
the
libraries
will
be
able
to
provide
more
journals
more
computerized
databases
for
locating
vital
information
and
more
equipment
for
rapid
access
to
the
computerized
catalog
and
indexes
i
ask
you
to
join
me
in
renewing
your
pledge
of
support
to
the
university
libraries
at
iupui
and
to
consider
increasing
that
contribution
at
whatever
level
you
may
contribute
your
gift
will
make
a
difference
to
all
the
present
and
future
users
of
the

and
will
foster
continued
excellence

dear
name
i
am
sure
that
you
are
aware
of
the
uncertainty
many
arts
organizations
are
currently
facing
in
regard
to
future
funding
as
a
member
of
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
indianapolis
civic
theatre
i
believe
that
the
dilemma
we
re
faced
with
is
not
how
we
can
afford
to
continue
our
programming
at
its
current
level
of
excellence
but
rather
how
we
can
rally
the
community
to
support
these
efforts
that
only
serve
to
enhance
the
cultural
splendor
of
our
city
and
provide
educational
outlets
for
our
children
the
indianapolis
civic
theatre
has
entertained
her
audiences
with
professionally
produced
plays
and
musicals
for
years
while
providing
an
arena
for
our
city
s
exceptional
talent
but
that
is
certainly
not
the
extent
of
it
youth
oriented
programs
like
junior
civic
kid
connection
and
the
young
adults
summer
musical
provide
unequaled
educational
opportunities
to
children
throughout
indiana
who
may
not
otherwise
have
exposure
to
the
performing
arts
the
impact
of
these
programs
on
the
children
involved
is
immeasurable
i
ve
enclosed
a
brochure
which
explains
in
more
detail
the
many
worthy
efforts
of
the
indianapolis
civic
theatre
as
well
as
a
pledge
card
and
return
envelope
in
hope
that
you
will
join
me
in
supporting
the
theatre
s
mission
furthermore
i
hope
you
ll
agree
with
me
in
that
your
continued
support
of
the
arts
is
an
investment
in
the
cultural
heritage
of
our
city

year
with
a
heritage
built
on

the

theatre
in
the
nation
means
that
through
prosperity
and
depression
war
and
peace
through
the
best
and
worst
of
times
civic
has
continued
to
produce
quality
family
entertainment
for
our
community
also
since
the
s
junior
civic
has
been
instilling
in
children
an
appreciation
not
just
for

for
the
dreams
of
which
theatre
is
made
i
made
my
indianapolis
debut
as
a

director
a
month
ago
with
inherit

of

be
peter

a
tribute
to
children
and
we
re
expecting
at
least
such
youngsters
to
attend
the
board
and

that
the
future
of
the
arts
is
in
the
hands
of
these
little
people
and
we
strive
to
insure
the
future
of
live
theatre
with
programs
like
the
holiday
family
production

student
matinee
series

young
adult
summer
musical
junior
civic
programs
and
kid
connection
i
hope
that
the

is
still
as
important
to
this
community
as
it
was
in
when
a
group
of
dreamers
got
together
to
begin
the
legacy
that
is
now
the
booth
tarkington
civic
theatre
of
indianapolis
i
hope
that
dreams
of
flying
and
pirates
and
fairy
dust
are
still
part
of
the
magic
of
childhood
and
i
hope
that

efforts

a
technique
that
is
both
effective
and
replicable
this
is
extremely
important
to
the
long
term
survival
of
elephants
in
human
care
as
well
as
the
wild
connection
through
animals
you
can
see
almost
animals
at
the
indianapolis
zoo
but
what
you
won
t
see
are
any
cages
our
zoo
was
designed
using
the
concept
of
biomes
which
simulate
the
natural
habitats
in
which
animals
live
creating
natural
habitats
does
more
than
enhance
the
beauty
of
the
zoo
it
allows
the
animals
to
feel
more
relaxed
and
encourages
their
natural
behaviors
our
keepers
help
to
provide
opportunities
for
increased
foraging
environmental
stimulation
and
social
contact
by
using
a
wide
array
of
scents
objects
and
food
enrichment
activities
include
hiding
special
treats
like
honey
or
peanut
butter
or
giving
animals
blocks
of
ice
indestructible
balls
or
browse
leafy
tree
branches
with
which
to
interact
understanding
an
animal
s
natural
behavior
increases
conservation
opportunities
particularly
captive
breeding
efforts
of
endangered
species
the

plan

management
and

program
for
selected
species
in
zoos
and

by
keeping
detailed

stud
books
zoo
staff
can
make
intelligent
decisions
on
how
to
match
individual

to
avoid
inbreeding
and
maintain
a

theatre
is
a
mirror
of
society
through
the
action
on
the
stage
we
are
able
to
see
really
see
ourselves
reflected
how
we
think
how
we
emotionally
react
our
failings
shortcomings
and
hesitations
are
on
display
as
are
the
remarkability
of
our
spirit
and
energy
the

takes
advantage
of
the
mirror
concept
to
let
today
s
youth
take
a
look
at
themselves
with
your
involvement
we
can
help
kids
like
the

become

if
you

t
yet
seen
the
show
let
me
tell
you
that
it
is
a
different
abe
lincoln
than
you
have
ever
seen
this
shows
a
young
lincoln
before
his
status
as
an
american
legend
this
demonstrates
a
man
who
is
fighting
with
all
of
his
might
to
make
honorable
decisions
face
down
personal
demons
and
accept
a
mantle
of
responsibility
he
really
doesn
t
want
to
assume
the
presidency
in
other
words
lincoln
is
portrayed
as
a
real
human
being
mirroring
all
of
us
that
would
find
ourselves
in
his
shoes
over
indiana
children
will
see
this
play
through
our
student
matinee
program
the
irt
s
education
program
is
one
of
the
strongest
in
the
country
a
fact
that
has
been
validated

proven
by
the

the

now
back
to

of

imagine
if
a
child
can
see
him
or
herself
in
abe
lincoln
s
shoes
facing
the
same
kind
of
doubts
fears
and
self
criticisms
that
abe
saw
in
himself
prior
to
his
presidency
mirroring
abe
s
actions
and
seeing
the
results
he
or
she
can
become
that
much
more
confident
that
much
more
able
to
face
a
difficult
world
and
that
much
more
willing
to
face
personal

janet
allen
artistic
director
january
dear
friend
for
years
i
have
had
the
tremendous
opportunity
to
be
an
actor
at
the
indiana
repertory
theatre
one
of
the
joys
of
being
an
actor
is
having
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
members
of
the
audience
following
a
performance
one
such
event
occurred
last
season
following
a
show
a
young
couple
came
up
to
the
stage
to
say
hello
they
said
they
both
felt
they
knew
me
like
an
old
friend
because
they
d
been
coming
to
see
irt
shows
since
their
high
school
days
in
fact
even
though
they
had
gone
to
separate
schools
each
one
s
first
experience
with
live
theatre
was
an
irt
production
i
was
delighted
at
their
vivid
recollections
of
some
of
my
favorite
shows
at
the
irt
midsummer
night
s
dream
and
you
can
t
take
it
with
you
they
said
that
because
of
those
high
school
trips
to
the
irt
they
have
made
professional
theatre
an
integral
part
of
their
cultural
lives
so
many
people
have
told
me
that
seeing
a
play
as
a
student
literally
opened
their
eves
and
minds
to
a
whole
new
world
a
world
of
imagination
more
powerful
than
any
futuristic
movie
or
television
sit
com
as
adults
they
crave
that
potent
mix
of
actor
playwright
and
audience
which
is
the
magic
of
live
theatre
it
s
that
magic
i
am
asking
you
to
keep
alive
and
well
for
all
children
in
the
state
of
indiana
fully
professional
fully
produced
theatre
has
made
a
difference
to
children
like
becky
stephanie
marcus
emily
and
their
classmates
from
across
the
state
of
indiana
i
ve
enclosed
letters
they
and
some
of
their
teachers
have
written
us
please
read
them
they
touched
my
heart
and
i
know
they
ll
touch
yours
the
one
thing
i
am
most
proud
of
is
that
the
irt
is
a
leader
across
the
country
in
providing
theatre
experiences
for
students
the
work
the
irt
does
with
teachers
and
students
has
a
profound
impact
on
their
lives
most
important
is
the
fact
that
attending
a
performance
at
the
irt
is
not
just
a
field
trip
the
irt
has
staff
educators
artists
and
a
statewide
student
teacher
advisory
committee
that
carefully
plan
all
the
education
programs
the
plays
which
are
performed
are
selected
because
they
have
a
specific
link
to
what
is
being
studied
in
the
classroom
whether
its
a
literature
topic
a
humanities
issue
or
an
important
person
in
history
every
play
has
a
direct
tie
in
to
classroom
curriculum
the
education
programs
at
the
irt
are
more
comprehensive
than
any
other
performing
arts
organization
in
the
state
of
indiana
and
possibly
the
nation
a
full
array
of
educational
services
are
incorporated
to
enhance
the
learning
experience
for
the
students
including
printed
study
guides
and
detailed
audio

materials

dear
my
love
affair
with
the
irt
is
a
long
one
i
joined
the
company
of
the
irt
in
with
my
first
show
harvey
and
i
can
t
believe
it
but
i
just
completed
my
th
production
at
the
indiana
repertory
theatre
in
pygmalion
i
am
very
proud
of
my
association
with
such
a
dynamic
regional
theatre
our
growth
has
not
stopped
and
it
s
all
due
to
you
now
as
an
associate
artist
with
the
theatre
i
see
daily
the
impact
that
the
irt
has
on
our
community
we
employ
more
professional
actors
from
the
community
ones
whom
we
have
helped
train
than
ever
in
our
history
we
now
have
grown
to
subscribers
from
in
the
irt
s
first
season
but
what
i
m
proudest
of
is
that
our
education
program
has
become
a
national
leader
among
fully
professional
not
for
profit
regional
theatres
you
are
responsible
for
helping
us
introduce
the
amazing
magical
experience
of
live
theatre
to
our
state
s
children
programs
that
are
not
only
an
arts
experience
but
help
teach
history
literature
and
social
studies
in
you
could
buy
an
individual
ticket
anywhere
from
and
a
subscription
for
ticket
prices
have
risen
but
they
still
only
account
for
of
our
budget
and
of
that
education
program
ticket
revenue
is
a
mere
fraction
of
that
so
our
contributions
from
corporations
foundations
and
individuals
like
you
enable
us
to
continue
these
critically
needed
services
i
am
writing
to
ask
for
your
direct
assistance
in
our
education
programs
and
artistic
product
what
began
as
a
touring
group
of
actors
in
that
played
to
students
in
cities
like
gary
elkhart
and
terre
haute
the
irt
education
program
today
now
provides
artist
in
the
classroom
programs
where
community
artists
teach
creative
dramatics
and
theatre
to
students
who
can
t
attend
the
irt
because
of
location
or
unfortunately
because
of
finances
the
discovery
series
which
produces
theatre
for
youth
began
in
where
around
students
see
a
live
production
discounted
student
matinee
mainstage
performances
where
students
saw
pygmalion
and
are
scheduled
to
see
a
christmas
carol
what
a
delight
it
is
for
us
to
introduce
the
magic
of
live
theatre
to
such
eager
faces
each
morning
in
all
nearly
students
from
of
indiana
counties
are
reached
by
an
irt
education
program
each
year
and
what
s
more
every
play
has
a
direct
tie
in
to
classroom
curriculum
as
an
actress
my
primary
joy
is
the
communication
that
occurs
between
an
actor
and
an
audience
now
i
m
communicating
to
you
as
a
friend
and
fellow
donor
who
loves
the
irt
you
wouldn
t
have
been
able
to
experience
the
joys
of
plays
i
have
been
in
and
those
i
haven
t
without
donations
other
than
ticket
purchases
your
last
gift
to
the
irt
was
as
you
consider
your
charitable
aiding
as
ends
i
ask
you
to
consider
increasing
that
gift
by
or
more
every
dollar
counts
i
look

to
hearing
from
you

you

this

we

more
than
ever
to
support
our
thrilling
productions
to
maintain
our
financial
stability
we
must
raise
by
june
from
friends
like
you
why
because
our
commitment
to
professional
quality
productions
and
strong
educational
outreach
across
the
state
requires
strong
community
support
although
inflation
is
low
our
productions
are
very
labor
intensive
and
most
exceed
the
rate
of
inflation
we
ve
kept
ticket
prices
very
affordable
and
in
fact
provide
amazing
student
ticket
discounts
if
we
keep
our
prices
low
we
need
to
come
to
you
our
audience
members
to
ask
for
a
small
contribution
in
order
to
help
us
meet
this
mission
it
s
just
a
play
right
why
so
expensive
here
are
just
a
few
examples
we
use
professional
career
actors
who
belong
to
a
union
called
actors
equity
unlike
other
not
for
profit
theatres
in
the
city
our
actors
make
their
living
from
their
craft
we
find
these
outstanding
actors
in
new
york
chicago
minneapolis
los
angeles
and
right
here
at
home
this
means
not
only
salary
and
benefits
but
also
housing
and
transportation
are
primary
expenses
each
year
one
week
s
salary
and
expenses

one
irt
equity
actor
is
including
rehearsals
the
irt
is
the
only
professional
not
for
profit
resident
theatre
in
the
state
this
means
our
commitment
to
quality
is
shown
backstage
as
nationally
known
professional
designers
and
directors
create
the
exciting
theatre
you
enjoy
elaborate
costumes
and
sets
are
an
irt
trademark
the
quality
of
our
sets
and
costumes
differ
from
other
theatres
in
the
city
too
to
costume
the
upcoming
pygmalion
a
national
search
for
the
right
fabric
for
henry
higgins
suits
took
place
and
was
finally
found
in
new
york
the
materials
for
the
pygmalion
costumes
will
cost
we
don
t
just
go
to
the
nearest
fabric
store
and
try
to
find
the
closest
thing
to
what
we
want
our
artistic
standards
dictate
that
we
look
until
we
get
it
right
deeply
discounting
student
matinee
tickets
for
children
to
see
a
play
as
low
as
vs
a
full
priced
ticket
of
for
an
adult
evening
performance
vs
for
a
broadway
touring
production
these
matinees
are
coordinated
with
teachers
and
unite
a
play
with
studies
of
classroom
lessons
in
history
social
studies
cultural
diversity
and
literature
for
a
full
educational
experience
you
may
have
heard
about
our
million
lobby
restoration
that
will
thrill
you
when
you
walk
through
the
doors
what
you
may
not
know
is
that
the
money
for
that
restoration
came
from
a
capital
and
endowment
fund
separate
from
the
money
needed
annually
to
produce
our
plays
and
education
programs
your
gift
would
go
directly
to
the
artistic
product
on
stage
and
our
nationally
recognized
education
program
which
last
year
reached
more
than
students
from
of
indiana
s
counties
this
outreach
is
a
increase
from
last
year
and
it
means
our
efforts
are
working
to
continue
to
make
it
work
we
need
you
last
year
you
generously
donated
please

dear
as
a
former

you
may
know
that
the

has
enjoyed
a
strong
start
to
our

and
we
thank
you
for
your
interest
and
support
we
depend
on
friends
like
you
to
help
us
bring
outstanding
productions
to
the
stage
we
just
finished
producing
a
christmas
carol
for
the
fourth
consecutive
year
enabling
thousands
of
families
and
students
the
opportunity
to
celebrate
the
holidays
together
it
is
your
support
and
our
commitment
to
low
prices
for
youth
that
makes
that
possible
in
total
because
of
the
gifts
given
last
year
we
were
able
to
discount
tickets
for
nearly
children
who
would
ordinarily
not
be
able
to
enjoy
the
wonders
of
live
theatre
and
do
our
productions
impact
education
by
reaching
students
whom
are
not
otherwise
being
reached
through
school
and
other
community
institutions
it
is
a
proven
fact
that
the
arts
contribute
to
higher
scores
on
the
sat
and
other
standardized
tests
by
transforming
the
environment
for
learning
school
lessons
become
opportunities
of
discovery
when
performed
live
on
stage
by
providing
new
challenges
for
those
students
already
considered
successful
and
helping
them
surpass
boredom
and
complacency
which
are
barriers
to
success
so
far
we
ve
been
very
successful
in
our
service
to
the
community
but
we
need
your
financial
support
right
now
to
complete
the
season
with
the
same
gusto
your
last
gift
was
we
hope
you
ll
help
us
with
more
this
year

that

makes
a
big
difference

s
thrilling
to
have
such
a
strong
impact
on
the

now
your

some

turning

already
understand
the
importance
of
storytelling
poetry

and
theatre
in
fostering
empathy
compassion
and
the
imagination
and
you
probably
also
have
a
keen
appreciation
for
the
role
of
the
oral
tradition
in
bringing
people
together
from
diverse
cultures
nationalities
and
religions
bridging
the
gap
between
our
differences
and
helping
to
foster
peace
instead
of
conflict
and
misunderstanding
this
is
what
it
means
to
keep
the
wisdom
lore
alive
and
right
now
we
need
your
help
to
do
it
a
donation
of
any
amount
would
be
deeply
appreciated
or
perhaps
you
know
of
someone
else
who

dear
friend
in
christ
a
gift
wrapped
box
under
a
christmas
tree
ordinarily
this
is
such
a
happy
sight
an
image
of
the
anticipation
that
we
feel
inside
as
the
holiday
season
approaches
once
again
but
in
certain
homes
this
christmas
the
sight
of
unopened
gifts
under
the
tree
will
bring
tears
of
grief
and
sorrow
for
these
boxes
will
remain
in
their
wrappings
long
after
all
of
the
other
presents
are
opened
christmas
will
come
and
go
and
these
gifts
will
sit
untouched
the
boxes
will
be
marked
with
the
names
of
cassie
corey
rachel
isaiah
kelly
kyle
and
the
other
students
of
columbine
high
school
who
lost
their
lives
earlier
this
year
all
around
our
country
christmas
presents
bearing
the
names
of
school
children
will
stay
in
their
ribbons
and
wrappings
under
the
tree
because
of
the
escalating
epidemic
of
violence
against
children
in
recent
years
it
s
my
guess
that
you
are
asking
yourself
what
is
happening
to
our
children
what
is
wrong
with
our
world
in
our
public
schools
teenagers
are
forbidden
to
discuss
religious
topics
on
school
grounds
even
in
after
school
clubs
and
societies
young
people
are
exposed
daily
to
violence
pornography
and
other
unwholesome
influences
over
the
internet
it
s
my
guess
that
you
are
also
asking
yourself
what
can
i
do
to
help
my
intuition
of
course
has
a
very
specific
basis
you
are
a
person
who
cares
as
demonstrated
by
your
annual
stewardship
donation
to
your
parish
i
know
that
you
make
it
a
point
to
be
involved
in
your
community
and
to
support
a
variety
of
worthy
causes
consequently
i
know
that
you
go
to
extra
lengths
to
be
compassionate
and
caring
to
others
and
that
suggests
to
me
that
you
may
well
be
interested
in
joining
a
program
that
tries
to
help
our
children
in
the
face
of
the
problems
i
mentioned
above
on
the
chance
that
my
guess
is
right
i
am
writing
to
you
today
to
invite
you
to
become
a

that
needs
to
be
done
in
our
ministries
that
at
times
it

seem
overwhelming

dear
friend
have
you
ever
wondered
why
the

with
such
emotion
it
s
because

a
uniquely
american
indefinable
unshakable
spirit
within

which
is
brought
to
life
through
the
performances
of
our
olympic
athletes
do
you
remember
how
wonderful
and
how
proud
you
felt
in
when
the
young
united
states
hockey
team
beat
the
powerful
soviet
team
and
then
went
on
to
beat
finland
for
the
gold
the
sight
of
jim
craig
skating
around
the
arena
with
the
american
flag
draped
across
his
back
tears
of
joy
streaming
down
his
face
looking
for
his
father
in
the
crowd
or
in
when
year
old
mary
lou
retton
needing
a
in
her
final
event
to
tie
for
first
place
in
the
all
around
gymnastics
competition
vaulted
her
way

the
gold
by

a
perfect
i
remember
these
moments
as
i

you
do
and
i

recall
many
other
moving
performances
when
our
athletes
reached
deep
within
themselves
to
overcome
what
appeared
to
be
insurmountable
odds
the
story
of
our
olympic
athletes
is
one
of
personal
sacrifice
dedication
to
